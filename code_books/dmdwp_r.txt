HUCKLEBERRY FINN Scene: The Mississippi Valley Time: Forty to fifty years ago CHAPTER I. You do", "6": "n\u2019t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain\u2019t no matter. That book ", "7": "was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. Th", "8": "at is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt P", "9": "olly\u2014Tom\u2019s Aunt Polly, she is\u2014and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with ", "10": "some stretchers, as I said before. Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid i", "11": "n the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece\u2014all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled u", "12": "p. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round\u2014more t", "13": "han a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was ", "14": "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I c", "15": "ouldn\u2019t stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Saw", "16": "yer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be re", "17": "spectable. So I went back. The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, ", "18": "too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn\u2019t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and", "19": " feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. ", "20": "When you got to the table you couldn\u2019t go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a", "21": " little over the victuals, though there warn\u2019t really anything the matter with them,\u2014that is, nothing only everything was cooked", "22": " by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the thing", "23": "s go better. After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out a", "24": "ll about him; but byandby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn\u2019t care no more about ", "25": "him, because I don\u2019t take no stock in dead people. Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn\u2019", "26": "t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn\u2019t clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people", "27": ". They get down on a thing when they don\u2019t know nothing about it. Here she was abothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, ", "28": "and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And", "29": " she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself. Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old m", "30": "aid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spellingbook. She worked me middling hard ", "31": "for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn\u2019t stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, an", "32": "d I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, \u201cDon\u2019t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t scrunch up like that, Huckleberr", "33": "y\u2014set up straight;\u201d and pretty soon she would say, \u201cDon\u2019t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry\u2014why don\u2019t you try to behave?\u201d T", "34": "hen she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn\u2019t mean no harm. All I wan", "35": "ted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn\u2019t particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wo", "36": "uldn\u2019t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn\u2019t see no advantage in goi", "37": "ng where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and", "38": " wouldn\u2019t do no good. Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would h", "39": "ave to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn\u2019t think much of it. But I never ", "40": "said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that,", "41": " because I wanted him and me to be together. Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. Byandby they ", "42": "fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put ", "43": "it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn\u2019t no use. I felt", "44": " so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard", "45": " an owl, away off, whowhooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to d", "46": "ie; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn\u2019t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run", "47": " over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that\u2019", "48": "s on its mind and can\u2019t make itself understood, and so can\u2019t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night gr", "49": "ieving. I got so downhearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I ", "50": "flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn\u2019t need anybody to tell me that", "51": " that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and", "52": " turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thr", "53": "ead to keep witches away. But I hadn\u2019t no confidence. You do that when you\u2019ve lost a horseshoe that you\u2019ve found, instead of nai", "54": "ling it up over the door, but I hadn\u2019t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you\u2019d killed a spider. I ", "55": "set down again, ashaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the wido", "56": "w wouldn\u2019t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom\u2014boom\u2014boom\u2014twelve licks; and all still ag", "57": "ain\u2014stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees\u2014something was a stirring. I set still ", "58": "and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a \u201c_meyow! meyow!_\u201d down there. That was good! Says I, \u201c_meyow! meyow!_\u201d as soft", "59": " as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and ", "60": "crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me. CHAPTER II. We went tiptoeing along a path am", "61": "ongst the trees back towards the end of the widow\u2019s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn\u2019t scrape our heads. When we ", "62": "was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson\u2019s big nigger, name", "63": "d Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stret", "64": "ched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says: \u201cWho dah?\u201d He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and sto"}, "3": {"1": "od right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn\u2019t a sound, and we a", "2": "ll there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn\u2019t scratch it; and then my ear begun to", "3": " itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I\u2019d die if I couldn\u2019t scratch. Well, I\u2019ve noticed that thing pl", "4": "enty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain\u2019t sleepy\u2014if you are anywhe", "5": "res where it won\u2019t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says: \u201cSay", "6": ", who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn\u2019 hear sumf\u2019n. Well, I know what I\u2019s gwyne to do: I\u2019s gwyne to set down here and", "7": " listen tell I hears it agin.\u201d So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretc", "8": "hed his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. B", "9": "ut I dasn\u2019t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to set", "10": " still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in ele", "11": "ven different places now. I reckoned I couldn\u2019t stand it more\u2019n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. J", "12": "ust then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore\u2014and then I was pretty soon comfortable again. Tom he made a sign to ", "13": "me\u2014kind of a little noise with his mouth\u2014and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispere", "14": "d to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they\u2019d find ou", "15": "t I warn\u2019t in. Then Tom said he hadn\u2019t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn\u2019t want him", "16": " to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid f", "17": "ive cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to", "18": " where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still", "19": " and lonesome. As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and byandby fetched up on the steep top o", "20": "f the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim\u2019s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and ", "21": "Jim stirred a little, but he didn\u2019t wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him al", "22": "l over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told", "23": " it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till byandby h", "24": "e said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddleboils. Jim was monstrous p", "25": "roud about it, and he got so he wouldn\u2019t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, an", "26": "d he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all ", "27": "over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was ", "28": "talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, \u201cHm! What you know \u2019bout witches?\u201d and that n", "29": "igger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that fivecenter piece round his neck with a string, and said it", "30": " was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he ", "31": "wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there ", "32": "and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that fivecenter piece; but they wouldn\u2019t touch it, because the devil had had", "33": " his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode b", "34": "y witches. Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four", "35": " lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village ", "36": "was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two ", "37": "or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the", "38": " big scar on the hillside, and went ashore. We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and t", "39": "hen showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our han", "40": "ds and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soo", "41": "n ducked under a wall where you wouldn\u2019t a noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of ro", "42": "om, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says: \u201cNow, we\u2019ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer\u2019", "43": "s Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.\u201d Everybody was willing. So Tom got ou", "44": "t a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of th", "45": "e secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family mus", "46": "t do it, and he mustn\u2019t eat and he mustn\u2019t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign", "47": " of the band. And nobody that didn\u2019t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it ag", "48": "ain he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his", "49": " carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again ", "50": "by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever. Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he ", "51": "got it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of piratebooks and robberbooks, and every gang that was hi", "52": "ghtoned had it. Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea,", "53": " so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says: \u201cHere\u2019s Huck Finn, he hain\u2019t got no family; what you going to do \u2019bo", "54": "ut him?\u201d \u201cWell, hain\u2019t he got a father?\u201d says Tom Sawyer. \u201cYes, he\u2019s got a father, but you can\u2019t never find him these days. He u", "55": "sed to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain\u2019t been seen in these parts for a year or more.\u201d They talked it over, ", "56": "and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn\u2019t be fa", "57": "ir and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of anything to do\u2014everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready ", "58": "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson\u2014they could kill her. Everybody said: \u201cOh, she\u2019ll d", "59": "o. That\u2019s all right. Huck can come in.\u201d Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark", "60": " on the paper. \u201cNow,\u201d says Ben Rogers, \u201cwhat\u2019s the line of business of this Gang?\u201d \u201cNothing only robbery and murder,\u201d Tom said.

I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and", "26": " I was dogtired. CHAPTER III.

I set down one time back in", "32": " the woods, and had a long think about it.

Why can\u2019t the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can\u2019t Miss Watson fat up? ", "34": "No, says I to myself, there ain\u2019t nothing in it.

Sometimes the widow ", "39": "would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body\u2019s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would tak", "40": "e hold and knock it all down again.

I didn\u2019t believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and Arabs, but I wanted to see the camels an", "64": "d elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down"}, "5": {"1": " the hill. But there warn\u2019t no Spaniards and Arabs, and there warn\u2019t no camels nor no elephants. It warn\u2019t anything but a Sunday", "2": "school picnic, and only a primerclass at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything", "3": " but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymnbook and a tract; and then the teacher ch", "4": "arged in, and made us drop everything and cut. I didn\u2019t see no di\u2019monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of th", "5": "em there, anyway; and he said there was Arabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn\u2019t we see them, then? He s", "6": "aid if I warn\u2019t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking.

I said, all right; then the thi", "9": "ng for us to do was to go for the magicians.

Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up. So the lo", "33": "nger I went to school the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow\u2019s ways, too, and they warn\u2019t so raspy on ", "34": "me.

I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new on", "36": "es, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn\u2019t ashamed", "37": " of me. One morning I happened to turn over the saltcellar at breakfast. I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw o", "38": "ver my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She says, \u201cTake your han", "39": "ds away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!\u201d The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn\u2019t going to keep off", "40": " the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.

I went down to the front garden and", "43": " clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and I seen somebod", "44": "y\u2019s tracks. They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden fence. It wa", "45": "s funny they hadn\u2019t come in, after standing around so.

I didn\u2019t notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross ", "47": "in the left bootheel made with big nails, to keep off the devil. I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over ", "48": "my shoulder every now and then, but I didn\u2019t see nobody. I was at Judge Thatcher\u2019s as quick as I could get there.

Here\u2019s a dollar for you. Now yo", "58": "u sign it.\u201d So I signed it, and left. Miss Watson\u2019s nigger, Jim, had a hairball as big as your fist, which had been took out of ", "59": "the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with it.

He said he would sh", "25": "ow who was Huck Finn\u2019s boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about thre", "26": "e mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn\u2019t no houses but an old log hut in a ", "27": "place where the timber was so thick you couldn\u2019t find it if you didn\u2019t know where it was.

He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.

The widow she found out where I was byandby, and she sent a man over to try to get ho", "32": "ld of me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn\u2019t long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it\u2014a", "33": "ll but the cowhide part.

I didn\u2019t want to go back no more. I had stopped cussin", "37": "g, because the widow didn\u2019t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn\u2019t no objections. It was pretty good times up in", "38": " the woods there, take it all around. But byandby pap got too handy with his hick\u2019ry, and I couldn\u2019t stand it. I was all over we", "39": "lts.

I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn\u2019t ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix up som", "41": "e way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn\u2019t find no way. There warn\u2019t a window to it ", "42": "big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn\u2019t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap ", "43": "was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much ", "44": "as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I f", "45": "ound something at last; I found an old rusty woodsaw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of t", "46": "he roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horseblanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin beh", "47": "ind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the", "48": " blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out\u2014big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job", "49": ", but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap\u2019s gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped th", "50": "e blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in. Pap warn\u2019t in a good humor\u2014so he was his natural self. He said he was dow", "51": "n town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got ", "52": "started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said peo", "53": "ple allowed there\u2019d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would", "54": " win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn\u2019t want to go back to the widow\u2019s any more and be so cramped up and", "55": " sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then ", "56": "cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn\u2019t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all ", "57": "round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn\u2019t know the names of, and so called them what\u2019shisname when he got", "58": " to them, and went right along with his cussing. He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch out, and ", "59": "if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till ", "60": "they dropped and they couldn\u2019t find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn\u2019t stay on h", "61": "and till he got that chance. The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fiftypound sack of", "62": " corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a fourgallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, bes", "63": "ides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I recko", "64": "ned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn\u2019t stay in one place,"}, "8": {"1": " but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the o", "2": "ld man nor the widow couldn\u2019t ever find me any more.

I got so full of it I didn\u2019t notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I", "4": " was asleep or drownded. I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While I was cooking supper the old ma", "5": "n took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutte", "6": "r all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought he was Adam\u2014he was just all mud.

I noticed some pieces of limbs and such th", "8": "ings floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have great times now i", "9": "f I was over at the town. The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood f", "10": "loating down, and pieces of log rafts\u2014sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to t", "11": "he woodyards and the sawmill.

Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck", "13": ". I shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected there\u2019d be som", "14": "ebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they\u2019d ", "15": "raise up and laugh at him.

But when I got to shore pap wasn\u2019t in sight yet, an", "17": "d as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I", "18": "\u2019d hide her good, and then, \u2019stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I\u2019d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one", "19": " place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot. It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the o", "20": "ld man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man do", "21": "wn the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn\u2019t seen anything. When he got along I was hard at it t", "22": "aking up a \u201ctrot\u201d line. He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me s", "23": "o long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines and went home.", "24": " While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some w", "25": "ay to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off", "26": " before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn\u2019t see no way for a while, but byandby pap raised", "27": " up a minute to drink another barrel of water, and he says: \u201cAnother time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out, you", "28": " hear? That man warn\u2019t here for no good. I\u2019d a shot him. Next time you roust me out, you hear?\u201d Then he dropped down and went to", "29": " sleep again; but what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody won\u2019t thi", "30": "nk of following me. About twelve o\u2019clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots", "31": " of driftwood going by on the rise. Byandby along comes part of a log raft\u2014nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff a", "32": "nd towed it ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but ", "33": "that warn\u2019t pap\u2019s style. Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and to", "34": "ok the skiff, and started off towing the raft about halfpast three. I judged he wouldn\u2019t come back that night. I waited till I r", "35": "eckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that log again. Before he was t\u2019other side of the r", "36": "iver I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder. I took the sack of corn meal and too", "37": "k it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of ba", "38": "con; then the whiskyjug. I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucke", "39": "t and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the coffeepot. I took fishlines", "40": " and matches and other things\u2014everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn\u2019t any, ", "41": "only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done. I had w", "42": "ore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the", "43": " outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back in", "44": "to its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn\u2019t quite ", "45": "touch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn\u2019t know it was sawed, you wouldn\u2019t never notice it; and besides, this ", "46": "was the back of the cabin, and it warn\u2019t likely anybody would go fooling around there. It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I", "47": " hadn\u2019t left a track. I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the river. All safe. So I took the gun a", "48": "nd went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bott", "49": "oms after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp. I took the axe and smashed in the", "50": " door. I beat it and hacked it considerable adoing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked in", "51": "to his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it _was_ ground\u2014hard packed, and no b", "52": "oards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it\u2014all I could drag\u2014and I started it from the pig, and dragge", "53": "d it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see th", "54": "at something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind ", "55": "of business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that. Well, last I p", "56": "ulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took", "57": " up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn\u2019t drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dump", "58": "ed him into the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and f", "59": "etched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for ther", "60": "e warn\u2019t no knives and forks on the place\u2014pap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking. Then I carried the sack abo", "61": "ut a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and ful", "62": "l of rushes\u2014and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that ", "63": "went miles away, I don\u2019t know where, but it didn\u2019t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to t", "64": "he lake. I dropped pap\u2019s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the mea"}, "10": {"1": "l sack with a string, so it wouldn\u2019t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again. It was about dark now; so I droppe", "2": "d the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a willow;", "3": " then I took a bite to eat, and byandby laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they\u2019ll fol", "4": "low the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they\u2019ll follow that meal track to the la", "5": "ke and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won\u2019t ever h", "6": "unt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They\u2019ll soon get tired of that, and won\u2019t bother no more about me. All right; I ", "7": "can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson\u2019s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there", "8": ". And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson\u2019s Island\u2019s the place. I was pre", "9": "tty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn\u2019t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked", "10": " around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted t", "11": "he drift logs that went aslipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it lo", "12": "oked late, and _smelt_ late. You know what I mean\u2014I don\u2019t know the words to put it in. I took a good gap and a stretch, and was ", "13": "just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dul", "14": "l kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it\u2019s a still night. I peeped out through the willow bran", "15": "ches, and there it was\u2014a skiff, away across the water. I couldn\u2019t tell how many was in it. It kept acoming, and when it was abre", "16": "ast of me I see there warn\u2019t but one man in it. Think\u2019s I, maybe it\u2019s pap, though I warn\u2019t expecting him. He dropped below me wi", "17": "th the current, and byandby he came aswinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun ", "18": "and touched him. Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough\u2014and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars. I didn\u2019t lose no time. The next mi", "19": "nute I was aspinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quar", "20": "ter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people migh", "21": "t see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float. I laid t", "22": "here, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep w", "23": "hen you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! ", "24": "I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too\u2014every word of it. One man said it was getting towards t", "25": "he long days and the short nights now. T\u2019other one said _this_ warn\u2019t one of the short ones, he reckoned\u2014and then they laughed, ", "26": "and he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn\u2019t la", "27": "ugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone. The first fellow said he \u2019lowed to tell it to his old woman\u2014she woul", "28": "d think it was pretty good; but he said that warn\u2019t nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it was n", "29": "early three o\u2019clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn\u2019t wait more than about a week longer. After that the talk got further and furt", "30": "her away, and I couldn\u2019t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed ", "31": "a long ways off. I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson\u2019s Island, about two mile and a half down strea", "32": "m, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. T", "33": "here warn\u2019t any signs of the bar at the head\u2014it was all under water now. It didn\u2019t take me long to get there. I shot past the he", "34": "ad at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois s", "35": "hore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I ", "36": "made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside. I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked ", "37": "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights tw", "38": "inkling. A monstrous big lumberraft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched", "39": " it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \u201cStern oars, there! heave her head to s", "40": "tabboard!\u201d I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side. There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into th", "41": "e woods, and laid down for a nap before breakfast. CHAPTER VIII. The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after ", "42": "eight o\u2019clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and", "43": " satisfied. I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them", "44": ". There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about ", "45": "a little, showing there was a little breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly. I wa", "46": "s powerful lazy and comfortable\u2014didn\u2019t want to get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a d", "47": "eep sound of \u201cboom!\u201d away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped u", "48": "p, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up\u2014about abreast ", "49": "the ferry. And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the matter now. \u201cBoom!\u201d I see the w", "50": "hite smoke squirt out of the ferryboat\u2019s side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to", "51": " the top. I was pretty hungry, but it warn\u2019t going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set ther", "52": "e and watched the cannonsmoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer ", "53": "morning\u2014so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened", "54": " to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the drownded ca", "55": "rcass and stop there. So, says I, I\u2019ll keep a lookout, and if any of them\u2019s floating around after me I\u2019ll give them a show. I ch", "56": "anged to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn\u2019t disappointed. A big double loaf come along,", "57": " and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in ", "58": "the closest to the shore\u2014I knowed enough for that. But byandby along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug", "59": " and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was \u201cbaker\u2019s bread\u201d\u2014what the quality eat; none of your low", "60": "down cornpone. I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferryboat, and", "61": " very well satisfied. And then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this br", "62": "ead would find me, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain\u2019t no doubt but there is something in that thing\u2014that is, there", "63": "\u2019s something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don\u2019t work for me, and I reckon it don\u2019t work for only", "64": " just the right kind. I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The ferryboat was floating with the current,"}, "11": {"1": " and I allowed I\u2019d have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did", "2": ". When she\u2019d got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down be", "3": "hind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where the log forked I could peep through. Byandby she come along, and she drifte", "4": "d in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat. Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and ", "5": "Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody was talking", "6": " about the murder, but the captain broke in and says: \u201cLook sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he\u2019s was", "7": "hed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water\u2019s edge. I hope so, anyway.\u201d I didn\u2019t hope so. They all crowded up and ", "8": "leaned over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see them firstrate, but they co", "9": "uldn\u2019t see me. Then the captain sung out: \u201cStand away!\u201d and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef", "10": " with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone. If they\u2019d a had some bullets in, I reckon they\u2019d ", "11": "a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn\u2019t hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around", "12": " the shoulder of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and further off, and byandby, after an hour, I didn\u2019", "13": "t hear it no more. The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn\u2019t yet ", "14": "a while. They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming onc", "15": "e in a while as they went. I crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the island they quit ", "16": "shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town. I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come ", "17": "ahunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods.

And, besides,", "30": " he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet? So we went back and got the cano", "31": "e, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in", "32": ", amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner. The door ", "33": "of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat a", "34": "nd a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner. We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat ", "35": "our dinner in there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thund", "36": "er and lighten; so the birds was right about it.

The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Il", "49": "linois bottom. On that side it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across\u2014a half a", "50": " mile\u2014because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs. Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mi", "51": "ghty cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.

The ", "61": "light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then we looked in at the window.

Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he", "3": " needn\u2019t done it; I didn\u2019t want to see him. There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky ", "4": "bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures ma", "5": "de with charcoal. There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sunbonnet, and some women\u2019s underclothes hanging against the wal", "6": "l, and some men\u2019s clothing, too.

The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in ", "10": "a hurry, and warn\u2019t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff. We got an old tin lantern, and a butcherknife without any hand", "11": "le, and a brannew Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and", "12": " a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and al", "13": "l such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, a", "14": "nd a roll of buckskin, and a leather dogcollar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn\u2019t have no label on them; a", "15": "nd just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good currycomb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow, and a wooden leg.

And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was re", "18": "ady to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe a", "19": "nd cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off. I paddled over to the Illino", "20": "is shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn\u2019t no accidents and di", "21": "dn\u2019t see nobody. We got home all safe. CHAPTER X. After breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come ", "22": "to be killed, but Jim didn\u2019t want to. He said it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha\u2019nt us; he said", "23": " a man that warn\u2019t buried was more likely to go aha\u2019nting around than one that was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty ", "24": "reasonable, so I didn\u2019t say no more; but I couldn\u2019t keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what t", "25": "hey done it for. We rummaged the clothes we\u2019d got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket ov", "26": "ercoat. Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they\u2019d a knowed the money was there they wouldn", "27": "\u2019t a left it. I said I reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn\u2019t want to talk about that. I says: \u201cNow you think it\u2019s bad lu", "28": "ck; but what did you say when I fetched in the snakeskin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday? You said it ", "29": "was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hands. Well, here\u2019s your bad luck! We\u2019ve raked in all this truc", "30": "k and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.\u201d \u201cNever you mind, honey, never you min", "31": "d. Don\u2019t you git too peart. It\u2019s acomin\u2019. Mind I tell you, it\u2019s acomin\u2019.\u201d It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that ta", "32": "lk. Well, after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to", "33": " the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on the foot of Jim\u2019s blanket, ever so", "34": " natural, thinking there\u2019d be some fun when Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the snake, and when Jim flung", "35": " himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake\u2019s mate was there, and bit him. He jumped up yelling, and the first", "36": " thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a second with a stick, and Jim", "37": " grabbed pap\u2019s whiskyjug and begun to pour it down. He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes o", "38": "f my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. ", "39": "Jim told me to chop off the snake\u2019s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he ea", "40": "t it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that woul", "41": "d help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn\u2019t going to let Jim find out it wa", "42": "s all my fault, not if I could help it. Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched ar", "43": "ound and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so d", "44": "id his leg; but byandby the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I\u2019d druther been bit with a snake than pa", "45": "p\u2019s whisky. Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind ", "46": "I wouldn\u2019t ever take aholt of a snakeskin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would ", "47": "believe him next time. And he said that handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn\u2019t got to the end of it y", "48": "et. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskin in his hand.", "49": " Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I\u2019ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder i", "50": "s one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less th", "51": "an two years he got drunk and fell off of the shottower, and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you ma", "52": "y say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn\u2019t see it. Pap ", "53": "told me. But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool. Well, the days went along, and the river went down", "54": " between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it an", "55": "d catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn\u2019t han", "56": "dle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. W", "57": "e found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there ", "58": "was a spool in it. Jim said he\u2019d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was", "59": " ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn\u2019t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at", "60": " the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there; everybody buys some of him; his meat\u2019s ", "61": "as white as snow and makes a good fry. Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring up some ", "62": "way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go ", "63": "in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said, couldn\u2019t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl", "64": "? That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got in"}, "15": {"1": "to it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the sunbonnet and tied it under my chin, and then f", "2": "or a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the dayt", "3": "ime, hardly. I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and byandby I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said", "4": " I didn\u2019t walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britchespocket. I took notice, and done bett", "5": "er. I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark. I started across to the town from a little below the ferryland", "6": "ing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I tied up and started along the bank. There was a lig", "7": "ht burning in a little shanty that hadn\u2019t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there. I slippe", "8": "d up and peeped in at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table.", "9": " I didn\u2019t know her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn\u2019t start a face in that town that I didn\u2019t know. Now this was lucky, ", "10": "because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this woman had been", "11": " in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t", "12": " forget I was a girl. CHAPTER XI. \u201cCome in,\u201d says the woman, and I did. She says: \u201cTake a cheer.\u201d I done it. She looked me all o", "13": "ver with her little shiny eyes, and says: \u201cWhat might your name be?\u201d \u201cSarah Williams.\u201d \u201cWhere \u2019bouts do you live?

She told about me", "25": " and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what a ", "26": "hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.

We put out the camp fire at ", "58": "the cavern the first thing, and didn\u2019t show a candle outside after that. I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and", "59": " took a look; but if there was a boat around I couldn\u2019t see it, for stars and shadows ain\u2019t good to see by.

Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire neve", "2": "r fooled them it warn\u2019t no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could. When the first streak of day began to show", "3": " we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up", "4": " the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cavein in the bank there. A towhead is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on", "5": " it as thick as harrowteeth. We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was d", "6": "own the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn\u2019t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and watched the r", "7": "afts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and upbound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all about", "8": " the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself _she_ woul", "9": "dn\u2019t set down and watch a camp fire\u2014no, sir, she\u2019d fetch a dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn\u2019t she tell her husband to fetch a", "10": " dog? Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he believed they must a gone uptown to get", "11": " a dog and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn\u2019t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village\u2014no, ", "12": "indeedy, we would be in that same old town again. So I said I didn\u2019t care what was the reason they didn\u2019t get us as long as they", "13": " didn\u2019t. When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and acro", "14": "ss; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather ", "15": "and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft", "16": ", so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves.

This second night we run between seven ", "23": "and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour.

It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the sta", "25": "rs, and we didn\u2019t ever feel like talking loud, and it warn\u2019t often that we laughed\u2014only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had m", "26": "ighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all\u2014that night, nor the next, nor the next. Every nigh", "27": "t we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. T", "28": "he fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty ", "29": "or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o\u2019clock that s", "30": "till night. There warn\u2019t a sound there; everybody was asleep. Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o\u2019clock at some ", "31": "little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents\u2019 worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken tha", "32": "t warn\u2019t roosting comfortable, and took him along.

Col.

His f", "41": "orehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of h", "42": "is life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; an", "43": "d on Sundays he wore a blue tailcoat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn\u2019t", "44": " no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn\u2019t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be\u2014you could feel that, you know, an", "45": "d so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a libertypole, an", "46": "d the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was", "47": " afterwards. He didn\u2019t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners\u2014everybody was always goodmannered where he was. Everybody", "48": " loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always\u2014I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a clou", "49": "dbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn\u2019t nothing go wrong again for a week. When him and t", "50": "he old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them goodday, and didn\u2019t set down again ", "51": "till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed i", "52": "t to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom\u2019s and Bob\u2019s was mixed, and then they bowed and said, \u201cOur duty to you, ", "53": "sir, and madam;\u201d and _they_ bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom p", "54": "oured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me", "55": " and Buck, and we drank to the old people too. Bob was the oldest and Tom next\u2014tall, beautiful men with very broad shoulders and", "56": " brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wor", "57": "e broad Panama hats. Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twentyfive, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she could b", "58": "e when she warn\u2019t stirred up; but when she was, she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father. She was", "59": " beautiful. So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only ", "60": "twenty. Each person had their own nigger to wait on them\u2014Buck too. My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn\u2019t used to", "61": " having anybody do anything for me, but Buck\u2019s was on the jump most of the time. This was all there was of the family now, but t", "62": "here used to be more\u2014three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died. The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hund", "63": "red niggers. Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days", "64": ", and have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house ni"}, "27": {"1": "ghts. These people was mostly kinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a handsome lot of quality, I ", "2": "tell you. There was another clan of aristocracy around there\u2014five or six families\u2014mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as", "3": " hightoned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamb", "4": "oat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a", "5": " lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses. One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse co", "6": "ming. We was crossing the road. Buck says: \u201cQuick! Jump for the woods!\u201d We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the l", "7": "eaves. Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had ", "8": "his gun across his pommel. I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck\u2019s gun go off at my ear, and Harn", "9": "ey\u2019s hat tumbled off from his head. He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we didn\u2019t wait. We s", "10": "tarted through the woods on a run. The woods warn\u2019t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Ha", "11": "rney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he come\u2014to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn\u2019t see. We never stopp", "12": "ed running till we got home. The old gentleman\u2019s eyes blazed a minute\u2014\u2019twas pleasure, mainly, I judged\u2014then his face sort of smo", "13": "othed down, and he says, kind of gentle: \u201cI don\u2019t like that shooting from behind a bush. Why didn\u2019t you step into the road, my b", "14": "oy?\u201d \u201cThe Shepherdsons don\u2019t, father. They always take advantage.\u201d Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck w", "15": "as telling his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. The two young men looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss S", "16": "ophia she turned pale, but the color come back when she found the man warn\u2019t hurt. Soon as I could get Buck down by the corncrib", "17": "s under the trees by ourselves, I says: \u201cDid you want to kill him, Buck?\u201d \u201cWell, I bet I did.\u201d \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d \u201cHim?

An", "57": "d so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and e", "58": "verybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.

Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of h", "64": "im, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off "}, "37": {"1": "of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, \u201cKnock him down! throw him out!\u201d and one or two women begun to scream.

It warn\u2019t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he str", "10": "uggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, areeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle ", "11": "and stood! and the horse agoing like a house afire too. He just stood up there, asailing around as easy and comfortable as if he", "12": " warn\u2019t ever drunk in his life\u2014and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clog", "13": "ged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits.

Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn\u2019t a ", "18": "been in that ringmaster\u2019s place, not for a thousand dollars. I don\u2019t know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was,", "19": " but I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me;_ and wherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_", "20": " custom every time. Well, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn\u2019t only about twelve people there\u2014just enough to pay expen", "21": "ses.

Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, a", "16": "nd they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more f", "17": "rom the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full.

When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, p", "24": "utting on the last touches, and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He", "25": " never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with ", "26": "his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there w", "27": "arn\u2019t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.

Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and s", "30": "traight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful", "31": " racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait\u2014you couldn\u2019t hear yourself t", "32": "hink.

But pretty soon they see that longlegged undertaker ", "33": "make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry\u2014just depend on me.\u201d Then he stooped down and begun to glide alon", "34": "g the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people\u2019s heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and m", "35": "ore outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in abou", "36": "t two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, ", "37": "and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker\u2019s back and shoulders glidi", "38": "ng along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with", "39": " his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people\u2019s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \u201c", "40": "_He had a rat!_\u201d Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to", "41": " the people, because naturally they wanted to know.

I was in a sweat th", "45": "en, and watched him pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight", "46": " and fast. So there I was!

And he said of co", "55": "urse him and William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well f", "56": "ixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too\u2014tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in", "57": " the world; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.

Yes, Austria ", "15": "was far from the world, and asleep, and our village was in the middle of that sleep, being in the middle of Austria. It drowsed ", "16": "in peace in the deep privacy of a hilly and woodsy solitude where news from the world hardly ever came to disturb its dreams, an", "17": "d was infinitely content. At its front flowed the tranquil river, its surface painted with cloudforms and the reflections of dri", "18": "fting arks and stoneboats; behind it rose the woody steeps to the base of the lofty precipice; from the top of the precipice fro", "19": "wned a vast castle, its long stretch of towers and bastions mailed in vines; beyond the river, a league to the left, was a tumbl", "20": "ed expanse of forestclothed hills cloven by winding gorges where the sun never penetrated; and to the right a precipice overlook", "21": "ed the river, and between it and the hills just spoken of lay a farreaching plain dotted with little homesteads nested among orc", "22": "hards and shade trees. The whole region for leagues around was the hereditary property of a prince, whose servants kept the cast", "23": "le always in perfect condition for occupancy, but neither he nor his family came there oftener than once in five years. When the", "24": "y came it was as if the lord of the world had arrived, and had brought all the glories of its kingdoms along; and when they went", "25": " they left a calm behind which was like the deep sleep which follows an orgy. Eseldorf was a paradise for us boys. We were not o", "26": "vermuch pestered with schooling. Mainly we were trained to be good Christians; to revere the Virgin, the Church, and the saints ", "27": "above everything. Beyond these matters we were not required to know much; and, in fact, not allowed to. Knowledge was not good f", "28": "or the common people, and could make them discontented with the lot which God had appointed for them, and God would not endure d", "29": "iscontentment with His plans. We had two priests. One of them, Father Adolf, was a very zealous and strenuous priest, much consi", "30": "dered. There may have been better priests, in some ways, than Father Adolf, but there was never one in our commune who was held ", "31": "in more solemn and awful respect. This was because he had absolutely no fear of the Devil. He was the only Christian I have ever", "32": " known of whom that could be truly said. People stood in deep dread of him on that account; for they thought that there must be ", "33": "something supernatural about him, else he could not be so bold and so confident. All men speak in bitter disapproval of the Devi", "34": "l, but they do it reverently, not flippantly; but Father Adolf's way was very different; he called him by every name he could la", "35": "y his tongue to, and it made everyone shudder that heard him; and often he would even speak of him scornfully and scoffingly; th", "36": "en the people crossed themselves and went quickly out of his presence, fearing that something fearful might happen. Father Adolf", "37": " had actually met Satan face to face more than once, and defied him. This was known to be so. Father Adolf said it himself. He n", "38": "ever made any secret of it, but spoke it right out. And that he was speaking true there was proof in at least one instance, for ", "39": "on that occasion he quarreled with the enemy, and intrepidly threw his bottle at him; and there, upon the wall of his study, was", "40": " the ruddy splotch where it struck and broke. But it was Father Peter, the other priest, that we all loved best and were sorries", "41": "t for. Some people charged him with talking around in conversation that God was all goodness and would find a way to save all hi", "42": "s poor human children. It was a horrible thing to say, but there was never any absolute proof that Father Peter said it; and it ", "43": "was out of character for him to say it, too, for he was always good and gentle and truthful. He wasn't charged with saying it in", "44": " the pulpit, where all the congregation could hear and testify, but only outside, in talk; and it is easy for enemies to manufac", "45": "ture that. Father Peter had an enemy and a very powerful one, the astrologer who lived in a tumbled old tower up the valley, and", "46": " put in his nights studying the stars. Every one knew he could foretell wars and famines, though that was not so hard, for there", "47": " was always a war, and generally a famine somewhere. But he could also read any man's life through the stars in a big book he ha", "48": "d, and find lost property, and every one in the village except Father Peter stood in awe of him. Even Father Adolf, who had defi", "49": "ed the Devil, had a wholesome respect for the astrologer when he came through our village wearing his tall, pointed hat and his ", "50": "long, flowing robe with stars on it, carrying his big book, and a staff which was known to have magic power. The bishop himself ", "51": "sometimes listened to the astrologer, it was said, for, besides studying the stars and prophesying, the astrologer made a great ", "52": "show of piety, which would impress the bishop, of course. But Father Peter took no stock in the astrologer. He denounced him ope", "53": "nly as a charlatana fraud with no valuable knowledge of any kind, or powers beyond those of an ordinary and rather inferior huma", "54": "n being, which naturally made the astrologer hate Father Peter and wish to ruin him. It was the astrologer, as we all believed, ", "55": "who originated the story about Father Peter's shocking remark and carried it to the bishop. It was said that Father Peter had ma", "56": "de the remark to his niece, Marget, though Marget denied it and implored the bishop to believe her and spare her old uncle from ", "57": "poverty and disgrace. But the bishop wouldn't listen. He suspended Father Peter indefinitely, though he wouldn't go so far as to", "58": " excommunicate him on the evidence of only one witness; and now Father Peter had been out a couple of years, and our other pries", "59": "t, Father Adolf, had his flock. Those had been hard years for the old priest and Marget. They had been favorites, but of course ", "60": "that changed when they came under the shadow of the bishop's frown. Many of their friends fell away entirely, and the rest becam", "61": "e cool and distant. Marget was a lovely girl of eighteen when the trouble came, and she had the best head in the village, and th", "62": "e most in it. She taught the harp, and earned all her clothes and pocket money by her own industry. But her scholars fell off on", "63": "e by one now; she was forgotten when there were dances and parties among the youth of the village; the young fellows stopped com", "64": "ing to the house, all except Wilhelm Meidlingand he could have been spared; she and her uncle were sad and forlorn in their negl"}, "74": {"1": "ect and disgrace, and the sunshine was gone out of their lives.

Urs", "17": "ula started homeward, with Agnes in her arms, and I said I wished I had her privilege of seeing Marget. Then I caught my breath,", "18": " for we were there. There in the parlor, and Marget standing looking at us, astonished. She was feeble and pale, but I knew that", "19": " those conditions would not last in Satan's atmosphere, and it turned out so. I introduced Satanthat is, Philip Traumand we sat ", "20": "down and talked. There was no constraint. We were simple folk, in our village, and when a stranger was a pleasant person we were", "21": " soon friends. Marget wondered how we got in without her hearing us. Traum said the door was open, and we walked in and waited u", "22": "ntil she should turn around and greet us. This was not true; no door was open; we entered through the walls or the roof or down ", "23": "the chimney, or somehow; but no matter, what Satan wished a person to believe, the person was sure to believe, and so Marget was", "24": " quite satisfied with that explanation. And then the main part of her mind was on Traum, anyway; she couldn't keep her eyes off ", "25": "him, he was so beautiful. That gratified me, and made me proud. I hoped he would show off some, but he didn't. He seemed only in", "26": "terested in being friendly and telling lies. He said he was an orphan. That made Marget pity him. The water came into her eyes. ", "27": "He said he had never known his mamma; she passed away while he was a young thing; and said his papa was in shattered health, and", "28": " had no property to speak ofin fact, none of any earthly valuebut he had an uncle in business down in the tropics, and he was ve", "29": "ry well off and had a monopoly, and it was from this uncle that he drew his support. The very mention of a kind uncle was enough", "30": " to remind Marget of her own, and her eyes filled again. She said she hoped their two uncles would meet, some day. It made me sh", "31": "udder. Philip said he hoped so, too; and that made me shudder again. \u201cMaybe they will,\u201d said Marget. \u201cDoes your uncle travel muc", "32": "h?\u201d \u201cOh yes, he goes all about; he has business everywhere.\u201d And so they went on chatting, and poor Marget forgot her sorrow for", "33": " one little while, anyway. It was probably the only really bright and cheery hour she had known lately. I saw she liked Philip, ", "34": "and I knew she would. And when he told her he was studying for the ministry I could see that she liked him better than ever. And", "35": " then, when he promised to get her admitted to the jail so that she could see her uncle, that was the capstone. He said he would", "36": " give the guards a little present, and she must always go in the evening after dark, and say nothing, \u201cbut just show this paper ", "37": "and pass in, and show it again when you come out\u201dand he scribbled some queer marks on the paper and gave it to her, and she was ", "38": "ever so thankful, and right away was in a fever for the sun to go down; for in that old, cruel time prisoners were not allowed t", "39": "o see their friends, and sometimes they spent years in the jails without ever seeing a friendly face.

I said no, and she was", "43": " relieved, and said please don't; for if Miss Marget knew, she would think it was an unholy cat and would send for a priest and ", "44": "have its gifts all purified out of it, and then there wouldn't be any more dividends. So I said we wouldn't tell, and she was sa", "45": "tisfied. Then I was beginning to say goodby to Marget, but Satan interrupted and said, ever so politelywell, I don't remember ju", "46": "st the words, but anyway he as good as invited himself to supper, and me, too. Of course Marget was miserably embarrassed, for s", "47": "he had no reason to suppose there would be half enough for a sick bird. Ursula heard him, and she came straight into the room, n", "48": "ot a bit pleased. At first she was astonished to see Marget looking so fresh and rosy, and said so; then she spoke up in her nat", "49": "ive tongue, which was Bohemian, and saidas I learned afterward\u201cSend him away, Miss Marget; there's not victuals enough.\u201d Before ", "50": "Marget could speak, Satan had the word, and was talking back to Ursula in her own languagewhich was a surprise to her, and for h", "51": "er mistress, too.

There were other surprises: flesh and game and wines and fruitsthings which had been", "61": " strangers in that house lately; but Marget made no exclamations, and now even looked unsurprised, which was Satan's influence, ", "62": "of course. Satan talked right along, and was entertaining, and made the time pass pleasantly and cheerfully; and although he tol", "63": "d a good many lies, it was no harm in him, for he was only an angel and did not know any better.

Very soon Ursula was mincing and simpering around in a ridiculous girly way, and smoothing out her gown", "3": " and prinking at herself like a foolish old hen, and all the time pretending she was not hearing what Satan was saying. I was as", "4": "hamed, for it showed us to be what Satan considered us, a silly race and trivial. Satan said his uncle entertained a great deal,", "5": " and to have a clever woman presiding over the festivities would double the attractions of the place. \u201cBut your uncle is a gentl", "6": "eman, isn't he?\u201d asked Marget. \u201cYes,\u201d said Satan indifferently; \u201csome even call him a Prince, out of compliment, but he is not b", "7": "igoted; to him personal merit is everything, rank nothing.\u201d My hand was hanging down by my chair; Agnes came along and licked it", "8": "; by this act a secret was revealed.

Satan smiled upon me, and I under", "10": "stood. When it was dark Marget took food and wine and fruit, in a basket, and hurried away to the jail, and Satan and I walked t", "11": "oward my home. I was thinking to myself that I should like to see what the inside of the jail was like; Satan overheard the thou", "12": "ght, and the next moment we were in the jail. We were in the torturechamber, Satan said.

There wer", "14": "e people thereand executionersbut as they took no notice of us, it meant that we were invisible. A young man lay bound, and Sata", "15": "n said he was suspected of being a heretic, and the executioners were about to inquire into it. They asked the man to confess to", "16": " the charge, and he said he could not, for it was not true. Then they drove splinter after splinter under his nails, and he shri", "17": "eked with the pain. Satan was not disturbed, but I could not endure it, and had to be whisked out of there. I was faint and sick", "18": ", but the fresh air revived me, and we walked toward my home. I said it was a brutal thing. \u201cNo, it was a human thing. You shoul", "19": "d not insult the brutes by such a misuse of that word; they have not deserved it,\u201d and he went on talking like that. \u201cIt is like", "20": " your paltry racealways lying, always claiming virtues which it hasn't got, always denying them to the higher animals, which alo", "21": "ne possess them.

We walked through a great factory of some sort, where men and women and little children were t", "29": "oiling in heat and dirt and a fog of dust; and they were clothed in rags, and drooped at their work, for they were worn and half", "30": " starved, and weak and drowsy. Satan said: \u201cIt is some more Moral Sense.

He had felt h", "49": "is blood leap and his spirits rise in a way that could mean only one thing, and he knew Satan was near, although it was too dark", "50": " to see him.

There was an uncomfortable silence, but relief soon came, ", "2": "for that poor dog came along now, with his eye hanging down, and went straight to Satan, and began to moan and mutter brokenly, ", "3": "and Satan began to answer in the same way, and it was plain that they were talking together in the dog language. We all sat down", "4": " in the grass, in the moonlight, for the clouds were breaking away now, and Satan took the dog's head in his lap and put the eye", "5": " back in its place, and the dog was comfortable, and he wagged his tail and licked Satan's hand, and looked thankful and said th", "6": "e same; I knew he was saying it, though I did not understand the words. Then the two talked together a bit, and Satan said: \u201cHe ", "7": "says his master was drunk.\u201d \u201cYes, he was,\u201d said we. \u201cAnd an hour later he fell over the precipice there beyond the Cliff Pasture", "8": ".\u201d \u201cWe know the place; it is three miles from here.\u201d \u201cAnd the dog has been often to the village, begging people to go there, but", "9": " he was only driven away and not listened to.\u201d We remembered it, but hadn't understood what he wanted. \u201cHe only wanted help for ", "10": "the man who had misused him, and he thought only of that, and has had no food nor sought any.

We got the men and Father Adolf, and we saw the man die. Nobody cared but the dog; he mourned and grieved, and licked the dead", "16": " face, and could not be comforted. We buried him where he was, and without a coffin, for he had no money, and no friend but the ", "17": "dog. If we had been an hour earlier the priest would have been in time to send that poor creature to heaven, but now he was gone", "18": " down into the awful fires, to burn forever.

Seppi had a very good thought as we ", "23": "were walking along, and it cheered us up and made us feel much better. He said the dog had forgiven the man that had wronged him", "24": " so, and maybe God would accept that absolution. There was a very dull week, now, for Satan did not come, nothing much was going", "25": " on, and we boys could not venture to go and see Marget, because the nights were moonlit and our parents might find us out if we", "26": " tried. But we came across Ursula a couple of times taking a walk in the meadows beyond the river to air the cat, and we learned", "27": " from her that things were going well. She had natty new clothes on and bore a prosperous look. The four groschen a day were arr", "28": "iving without a break, but were not being spent for food and wine and such thingsthe cat attended to all that. Marget was enduri", "29": "ng her forsakenness and isolation fairly well, all things considered, and was cheerful, by help of Wilhelm Meidling. She spent a", "30": "n hour or two every night in the jail with her uncle, and had fattened him up with the cat's contributions. But she was curious ", "31": "to know more about Philip Traum, and hoped I would bring him again. Ursula was curious about him herself, and asked a good many ", "32": "questions about his uncle. It made the boys laugh, for I had told them the nonsense Satan had been stuffing her with. She got no", "33": " satisfaction out of us, our tongues being tied. Ursula gave us a small item of information: money being plenty now, she had tak", "34": "en on a servant to help about the house and run errands. She tried to tell it in a commonplace, matterofcourse way, but she was ", "35": "so set up by it and so vain of it that her pride in it leaked out pretty plainly. It was beautiful to see her veiled delight in ", "36": "this grandeur, poor old thing, but when we heard the name of the servant we wondered if she had been altogether wise; for althou", "37": "gh we were young, and often thoughtless, we had fairly good perception on some matters. This boy was Gottfried Narr, a dull, goo", "38": "d creature, with no harm in him and nothing against him personally; still, he was under a cloud, and properly so, for it had not", "39": " been six months since a social blight had mildewed the familyhis grandmother had been burned as a witch. When that kind of a ma", "40": "lady is in the blood it does not always come out with just one burning. Just now was not a good time for Ursula and Marget to be", "41": " having dealings with a member of such a family, for the witchterror had risen higher during the past year than it had ever reac", "42": "hed in the memory of the oldest villagers. The mere mention of a witch was almost enough to frighten us out of our wits. This wa", "43": "s natural enough, because of late years there were more kinds of witches than there used to be; in old times it had been only ol", "44": "d women, but of late years they were of all ageseven children of eight and nine; it was getting so that anybody might turn out t", "45": "o be a familiar of the Devilage and sex hadn't anything to do with it. In our little region we had tried to extirpate the witche", "46": "s, but the more of them we burned the more of the breed rose up in their places. Once, in a school for girls only ten miles away", "47": ", the teachers found that the back of one of the girls was all red and inflamed, and they were greatly frightened, believing it ", "48": "to be the Devil's marks. The girl was scared, and begged them not to denounce her, and said it was only fleas; but of course it ", "49": "would not do to let the matter rest there. All the girls were examined, and eleven out of the fifty were badly marked, the rest ", "50": "less so. A commission was appointed, but the eleven only cried for their mothers and would not confess. Then they were shut up, ", "51": "each by herself, in the dark, and put on black bread and water for ten days and nights; and by that time they were haggard and w", "52": "ild, and their eyes were dry and they did not cry any more, but only sat and mumbled, and would not take the food. Then one of t", "53": "hem confessed, and said they had often ridden through the air on broomsticks to the witches' Sabbath, and in a bleak place high ", "54": "up in the mountains had danced and drunk and caroused with several hundred other witches and the Evil One, and all had conducted", "55": " themselves in a scandalous way and had reviled the priests and blasphemed God. That is what she saidnot in narrative form, for ", "56": "she was not able to remember any of the details without having them called to her mind one after the other; but the commission d", "57": "id that, for they knew just what questions to ask, they being all written down for the use of witchcommissioners two centuries b", "58": "efore. They asked, \u201cDid you do so and so?\u201d and she always said yes, and looked weary and tired, and took no interest in it. And ", "59": "so when the other ten heard that this one confessed, they confessed, too, and answered yes to the questions. Then they were burn", "60": "ed at the stake all together, which was just and right; and everybody went from all the countryside to see it. I went, too; but ", "61": "when I saw that one of them was a bonny, sweet girl I used to play with, and looked so pitiful there chained to the stake, and h", "62": "er mother crying over her and devouring her with kisses and clinging around her neck, and saying, \u201cOh, my God! Oh, my God!\u201d it w", "63": "as too dreadful, and I went away. It was bitter cold weather when Gottfried's grandmother was burned. It was charged that she ha", "64": "d cured bad headaches by kneading the person's head and neck with her fingersas she saidbut really by the Devil's help, as every"}, "83": {"1": "body knew. They were going to examine her, but she stopped them, and confessed straight off that her power was from the Devil. S", "2": "o they appointed to burn her next morning, early, in our marketsquare. The officer who was to prepare the fire was there first, ", "3": "and prepared it. She was there nextbrought by the constables, who left her and went to fetch another witch. Her family did not c", "4": "ome with her. They might be reviled, maybe stoned, if the people were excited. I came, and gave her an apple. She was squatting ", "5": "at the fire, warming herself and waiting; and her old lips and hands were blue with the cold. A stranger came next. He was a tra", "6": "veler, passing through; and he spoke to her gently, and, seeing nobody but me there to hear, said he was sorry for her. And he a", "7": "sked if what she confessed was true, and she said no. He looked surprised and still more sorry then, and asked her: \u201cThen why di", "8": "d you confess?\u201d \u201cI am old and very poor,\u201d she said, \u201cand I work for my living. There was no way but to confess. If I hadn't they", "9": " might have set me free. That would ruin me, for no one would forget that I had been suspected of being a witch, and so I would ", "10": "get no more work, and wherever I went they would set the dogs on me. In a little while I would starve. The fire is best; it is s", "11": "oon over. You have been good to me, you two, and I thank you.\u201d She snuggled closer to the fire, and put out her hands to warm th", "12": "em, the snowflakes descending soft and still on her old gray head and making it white and whiter. The crowd was gathering now, a", "13": "nd an egg came flying and struck her in the eye, and broke and ran down her face. There was a laugh at that. I told Satan all ab", "14": "out the eleven girls and the old woman, once, but it did not affect him. He only said it was the human race, and what the human ", "15": "race did was of no consequence. And he said he had seen it made; and it was not made of clay; it was made of mudpart of it was, ", "16": "anyway. I knew what he meant by thatthe Moral Sense. He saw the thought in my head, and it tickled him and made him laugh. Then ", "17": "he called a bullock out of a pasture and petted it and talked with it, and said: \u201cTherehe wouldn't drive children mad with hunge", "18": "r and fright and loneliness, and then burn them for confessing to things invented for them which had never happened. And neither", "19": " would he break the hearts of innocent, poor old women and make them afraid to trust themselves among their own race; and he wou", "20": "ld not insult them in their deathagony.

He always turned up his nose at it, and never had a kind word for it. Well, as I was saying, we", "23": " boys doubted if it was a good time for Ursula to be hiring a member of the Narr family. We were right. When the people found it", "24": " out they were naturally indignant. And, moreover, since Marget and Ursula hadn't enough to eat themselves, where was the money ", "25": "coming from to feed another mouth? That is what they wanted to know; and in order to find out they stopped avoiding Gottfried an", "26": "d began to seek his society and have sociable conversations with him.

They pay me t", "28": "wo groschen a week, besides my keep. And they live on the fat of the land, I can tell you; the prince himself can't beat their t", "29": "able.\u201d This astonishing statement was conveyed by the astrologer to Father Adolf on a Sunday morning when he was returning from ", "30": "mass. He was deeply moved, and said: \u201cThis must be looked into.\u201d He said there must be witchcraft at the bottom of it, and told ", "31": "the villagers to resume relations with Marget and Ursula in a private and unostentatious way, and keep both eyes open. They were", "32": " told to keep their own counsel, and not rouse the suspicions of the household. The villagers were at first a bit reluctant to e", "33": "nter such a dreadful place, but the priest said they would be under his protection while there, and no harm could come to them, ", "34": "particularly if they carried a trifle of holy water along and kept their beads and crosses handy. This satisfied them and made t", "35": "hem willing to go; envy and malice made the baser sort even eager to go. And so poor Marget began to have company again, and was", "36": " as pleased as a cat. She was like 'most anybody elsejust human, and happy in her prosperities and not averse from showing them ", "37": "off a little; and she was humanly grateful to have the warm shoulder turned to her and be smiled upon by her friends and the vil", "38": "lage again; for of all the hard things to bear, to be cut by your neighbors and left in contemptuous solitude is maybe the harde", "39": "st. The bars were down, and we could all go there now, and we didour parents and allday after day. The cat began to strain herse", "40": "lf. She provided the top of everything for those companies, and in abundanceamong them many a dish and many a wine which they ha", "41": "d not tasted before and which they had not even heard of except at secondhand from the prince's servants. And the tableware was ", "42": "much above ordinary, too. Marget was troubled at times, and pursued Ursula with questions to an uncomfortable degree; but Ursula", "43": " stood her ground and stuck to it that it was Providence, and said no word about the cat. Marget knew that nothing was impossibl", "44": "e to Providence, but she could not help having doubts that this effort was from there, though she was afraid to say so, lest dis", "45": "aster come of it. Witchcraft occurred to her, but she put the thought aside, for this was before Gottfried joined the household,", "46": " and she knew Ursula was pious and a bitter hater of witches. By the time Gottfried arrived Providence was established, unshakab", "47": "ly intrenched, and getting all the gratitude. The cat made no murmur, but went on composedly improving in style and prodigality ", "48": "by experience. In any community, big or little, there is always a fair proportion of people who are not malicious or unkind by n", "49": "ature, and who never do unkind things except when they are overmastered by fear, or when their selfinterest is greatly in danger", "50": ", or some such matter as that. Eseldorf had its proportion of such people, and ordinarily their good and gentle influence was fe", "51": "lt, but these were not ordinary timeson account of the witchdreadand so we did not seem to have any gentle and compassionate hea", "52": "rts left, to speak of. Every person was frightened at the unaccountable state of things at Marget's house, not doubting that wit", "53": "chcraft was at the bottom of it, and fright frenzied their reason. Naturally there were some who pitied Marget and Ursula for th", "54": "e danger that was gathering about them, but naturally they did not say so; it would not have been safe. So the others had it all", "55": " their own way, and there was none to advise the ignorant girl and the foolish woman and warn them to modify their doings. We bo", "56": "ys wanted to warn them, but we backed down when it came to the pinch, being afraid. We found that we were not manly enough nor b", "57": "rave enough to do a generous action when there was a chance that it could get us into trouble. Neither of us confessed this poor", "58": " spirit to the others, but did as other people would have donedropped the subject and talked about something else. And I knew we", "59": " all felt mean, eating and drinking Marget's fine things along with those companies of spies, and petting her and complimenting ", "60": "her with the rest, and seeing with selfreproach how foolishly happy she was, and never saying a word to put her on her guard. An", "61": "d, indeed, she was happy, and as proud as a princess, and so grateful to have friends again. And all the time these people were ", "62": "watching with all their eyes and reporting all they saw to Father Adolf. But he couldn't make head or tail of the situation. The", "63": "re must be an enchanter somewhere on the premises, but who was it?

There was nothing in the", "3": " books like this. Enchanted things were always unreal. Gold turned to dirt in an unenchanted atmosphere, food withered away and ", "4": "vanished. But this test failed in the present case. The spies brought samples: Father Adolf prayed over them, exorcised them, bu", "5": "t it did no good; they remained sound and real, they yielded to natural decay only, and took the usual time to do it. Father Ado", "6": "lf was not merely puzzled, he was also exasperated; for these evidences very nearly convinced himprivatelythat there was no witc", "7": "hcraft in the matter. It did not wholly convince him, for this could be a new kind of witchcraft. There was a way to find out as", "8": " to this: if this prodigal abundance of provender was not brought in from the outside, but produced on the premises, there was w", "9": "itchcraft, sure. Chapter 7 Marget announced a party, and invited forty people; the date for it was seven days away. This was a f", "10": "ine opportunity. Marget's house stood by itself, and it could be easily watched. All the week it was watched night and day. Marg", "11": "et's household went out and in as usual, but they carried nothing in their hands, and neither they nor others brought anything t", "12": "o the house. This was ascertained. Evidently rations for forty people were not being fetched. If they were furnished any sustena", "13": "nce it would have to be made on the premises. It was true that Marget went out with a basket every evening, but the spies ascert", "14": "ained that she always brought it back empty. The guests arrived at noon and filled the place. Father Adolf followed; also, after", "15": " a little, the astrologer, without invitation. The spies had informed him that neither at the back nor the front had any parcels", "16": " been brought in. He entered, and found the eating and drinking going on finely, and everything progressing in a lively and fest", "17": "ive way. He glanced around and perceived that many of the cooked delicacies and all of the native and foreign fruits were of a p", "18": "erishable character, and he also recognized that these were fresh and perfect. No apparitions, no incantations, no thunder. That", "19": " settled it. This was witchcraft. And not only that, but of a new kinda kind never dreamed of before. It was a prodigious power,", "20": " an illustrious power; he resolved to discover its secret. The announcement of it would resound throughout the world, penetrate ", "21": "to the remotest lands, paralyze all the nations with amazementand carry his name with it, and make him renowned forever. It was ", "22": "a wonderful piece of luck, a splendid piece of luck; the glory of it made him dizzy. All the house made room for him; Marget pol", "23": "itely seated him; Ursula ordered Gottfried to bring a special table for him. Then she decked it and furnished it, and asked for ", "24": "his orders. \u201cBring me what you will,\u201d he said. The two servants brought supplies from the pantry, together with white wine and r", "25": "eda bottle of each. The astrologer, who very likely had never seen such delicacies before, poured out a beaker of red wine, dran", "26": "k it off, poured another, then began to eat with a grand appetite. I was not expecting Satan, for it was more than a week since ", "27": "I had seen or heard of him, but now he came inI knew it by the feel, though people were in the way and I could not see him. I he", "28": "ard him apologizing for intruding; and he was going away, but Marget urged him to stay, and he thanked her and stayed. She broug", "29": "ht him along, introducing him to the girls, and to Meidling, and to some of the elders; and there was quite a rustle of whispers", "30": ": \u201cIt's the young stranger we hear so much about and can't get sight of, he is away so much.\u201d \u201cDear, dear, but he is beautifulwh", "31": "at is his name?\u201d \u201cPhilip Traum.\u201d \u201cAh, it fits him!\u201d (You see, \u201cTraum\u201d is German for \u201cDream.\u201d) \u201cWhat does he do?\u201d \u201cStudying for t", "32": "he ministry, they say.\u201d \u201cHis face is his fortunehe'll be a cardinal some day.\u201d \u201cWhere is his home?\u201d \u201cAway down somewhere in the ", "33": "tropics, they sayhas a rich uncle down there.\u201d And so on.

Everybody noticed how cool and fresh it was, all of a sudden, and wondered at it, for they could see that the sun was be", "35": "ating down the same as before, outside, and the sky was clear of clouds, but no one guessed the reason, of course. The astrologe", "36": "r had drunk his second beaker; he poured out a third. He set the bottle down, and by accident overturned it. He seized it before", "37": " much was spilled, and held it up to the light, saying, \u201cWhat a pityit is royal wine.\u201d Then his face lighted with joy or triumph", "38": ", or something, and he said, \u201cQuick!

Then Father Adolf rose up, flushed and excited, crossed hims", "42": "elf, and began to thunder in his great voice, \u201cThis house is bewitched and accursed!\u201d People began to cry and shriek and crowd t", "43": "oward the door. \u201cI summon this detected household to\u201d His words were cut off short.

With", "49": " my powers I can even do much more.\u201d A frightened cry burst out everywhere. \u201cOh, my God, he is possessed!\u201d and there was a tumul", "50": "tuous rush for the door which swiftly emptied the house of all who did not belong in it except us boys and Meidling. We boys kne", "51": "w the secret, and would have told it if we could, but we couldn't. We were very thankful to Satan for furnishing that good help ", "52": "at the needful time.

He seemed to trust anything that hadn't the Mor", "58": "al Sense. Outside, the guests, panicstricken, scattered in every direction and fled in a pitiable state of terror; and such a tu", "59": "mult as they made with their running and sobbing and shrieking and shouting that soon all the village came flocking from their h", "60": "ouses to see what had happened, and they thronged the street and shouldered and jostled one another in excitement and fright; an", "61": "d then Father Adolf appeared, and they fell apart in two walls like the cloven Red Sea, and presently down this lane the astrolo", "62": "ger came striding and mumbling, and where he passed the lanes surged back in packed masses, and fell silent with awe, and their ", "63": "eyes stared and their breasts heaved, and several women fainted; and when he was gone by the crowd swarmed together and followed", "64": " him at a distance, talking excitedly and asking questions and finding out the facts.

The spinni", "8": "ng great oval reached up twenty feet in the air and was a shining and glinting and wonderful sight.

Then he turned and saw the tightrope, and said foolish people were daily wasting their money to see a clumsy and ", "13": "ignorant varlet degrade that beautiful art; now they should see the work of a master. With that he made a spring into the air an", "14": "d lit firm on his feet on the rope. Then he hopped the whole length of it back and forth on one foot, with his hands clasped ove", "15": "r his eyes; and next he began to throw somersaults, both backward and forward, and threw twentyseven. The people murmured, for t", "16": "he astrologer was old, and always before had been halting of movement and at times even lame, but he was nimble enough now and w", "17": "ent on with his antics in the liveliest manner. Finally he sprang lightly down and walked away, and passed up the road and aroun", "18": "d the corner and disappeared. Then that great, pale, silent, solid crowd drew a deep breath and looked into one another's faces ", "19": "as if they said: \u201cWas it real? Did you see it, or was it only Iand was I dreaming?\u201d Then they broke into a low murmur of talking", "20": ", and fell apart in couples, and moved toward their homes, still talking in that awed way, with faces close together and laying ", "21": "a hand on an arm and making other such gestures as people make when they have been deeply impressed by something. We boys follow", "22": "ed behind our fathers, and listened, catching all we could of what they said; and when they sat down in our house and continued ", "23": "their talk they still had us for company. They were in a sad mood, for it was certain, they said, that disaster for the village ", "24": "must follow this awful visitation of witches and devils. Then my father remembered that father Adolf had been struck dumb at the", "25": " moment of his denunciation. \u201cThey have not ventured to lay their hands upon an anointed servant of God before,\u201d he said; \u201cand h", "26": "ow they could have dared it this time I cannot make out, for he wore his crucifix.

They discussed this, that, and the other way, and talked till the afternoon was far ", "36": "spent, then confessed that at present they could arrive at no decision. So they parted sorrowfully, with oppressed hearts which ", "37": "were filled with bodings. While they were saying their parting words I slipped out and set my course for Marget's house to see w", "38": "hat was happening there. I met many people, but none of them greeted me. It ought to have been surprising, but it was not, for t", "39": "hey were so distraught with fear and dread that they were not in their right minds, I think; they were white and haggard, and wa", "40": "lked like persons in a dream, their eyes open but seeing nothing, their lips moving but uttering nothing, and worriedly clasping", "41": " and unclasping their hands without knowing it. At Marget's it was like a funeral. She and Wilhelm sat together on the sofa, but", "42": " said nothing, and not even holding hands. Both were steeped in gloom, and Marget's eyes were red from the crying she had been d", "43": "oing. She said: \u201cI have been begging him to go, and come no more, and so save himself alive. I cannot bear to be his murderer. T", "44": "his house is bewitched, and no inmate will escape the fire. But he will not go, and he will be lost with the rest.\u201d Wilhelm said", "45": " he would not go; if there was danger for her, his place was by her, and there he would remain. Then she began to cry again, and", "46": " it was all so mournful that I wished I had stayed away. There was a knock, now, and Satan came in, fresh and cheery and beautif", "47": "ul, and brought that winy atmosphere of his and changed the whole thing. He never said a word about what had been happening, nor", "48": " about the awful fears which were freezing the blood in the hearts of the community, but began to talk and rattle on about all m", "49": "anner of gay and pleasant things; and next about musican artful stroke which cleared away the remnant of Marget's depression and", "50": " brought her spirits and her interests broad awake. She had not heard any one talk so well and so knowingly on that subject befo", "51": "re, and she was so uplifted by it and so charmed that what she was feeling lit up her face and came out in her words; and Wilhel", "52": "m noticed it and did not look as pleased as he ought to have done. And next Satan branched off into poetry, and recited some, an", "53": "d did it well, and Marget was charmed again; and again Wilhelm was not as pleased as he ought to have been, and this time Marget", "54": " noticed it and was remorseful. I fell asleep to pleasant music that nightthe patter of rain upon the panes and the dull growlin", "55": "g of distant thunder. Away in the night Satan came and roused me and said: \u201cCome with me. Where shall we go?\u201d \u201cAnywhereso it is ", "56": "with you.\u201d Then there was a fierce glare of sunlight, and he said, \u201cThis is China.\u201d That was a grand surprise, and made me sort ", "57": "of drunk with vanity and gladness to think I had come so farso much, much farther than anybody else in our village, including Ba", "58": "rtel Sperling, who had such a great opinion of his travels.

For instanceH", "60": "owever, I may go into that by and by, and also why Satan chose China for this excursion instead of another place; it would inter", "61": "rupt my tale to do it now. Finally we stopped flitting and lit. We sat upon a mountain commanding a vast landscape of mountainra", "62": "nge and gorge and valley and plain and river, with cities and villages slumbering in the sunlight, and a glimpse of blue sea on ", "63": "the farther verge. It was a tranquil and dreamy picture, beautiful to the eye and restful to the spirit. If we could only make a", "64": " change like that whenever we wanted to, the world would be easier to live in than it is, for change of scene shifts the mind's "}, "86": {"1": "burdens to the other shoulder and banishes old, shopworn wearinesses from mind and body both.

Presently the thing happened which we were dreading. There was a sound of tram", "63": "ping and scraping outside, and a crowd came solemnly in, with heads uncovered, and laid the two drowned bodies on the bed. \u201cOh, ", "64": "my God!\u201d that poor mother cried out, and fell on her knees, and put her arms about her dead boy and began to cover the wet face "}, "90": {"1": "with kisses. \u201cOh, it was I that sent him, and I have been his death.

We thought it very good of him, but he said money did", "24": " not cost him anything. At the graveyard the body of little Lisa was seized for debt by a carpenter to whom the mother owed fift", "25": "y groschen for work done the year before. She had never been able to pay this, and was not able now. The carpenter took the corp", "26": "se home and kept it four days in his cellar, the mother weeping and imploring about his house all the time; then he buried it in", "27": " his brother's cattleyard, without religious ceremonies.

He said the", "34": " longest of her careers as they now stood gave her fortytwo years to live, and her shortest one twentynine, and that both were c", "35": "harged with grief and hunger and cold and pain.

After a little I began to feel troubled about Fischer, and asked, timidly, \u201cDoes this episode change Fischer's lifesc", "49": "heme, Satan?\u201d \u201cChange it? Why, certainly. And radically.

He had never felt a pain or a sorrow, and did not know what they were, in any really informing wa", "58": "y. He had no knowledge of them except theoreticallythat is to say, intellectually. And of course that is no good. One can never ", "59": "get any but a loose and ignorant notion of such things except by experience.

And how unconscious he was that anything had happened to him! You could see by his elastic step and his alert manner that h", "2": "e was well satisfied with himself for doing that hard turn for poor Frau Brandt. He kept glancing back over his shoulder expecta", "3": "ntly. And, sure enough, pretty soon Frau Brandt followed after, in charge of the officers and wearing jingling chains. A mob was", "4": " in her wake, jeering and shouting, \u201cBlasphemer and heretic!\u201d and some among them were neighbors and friends of her happier days", "5": ". Some were trying to strike her, and the officers were not taking as much trouble as they might to keep them from it. \u201cOh, stop", "6": " them, Satan!\u201d It was out before we remembered that he could not interrupt them for a moment without changing their whole afterl", "7": "ives. He puffed a little puff toward them with his lips and they began to reel and stagger and grab at the empty air; then they ", "8": "broke apart and fled in every direction, shrieking, as if in intolerable pain. He had crushed a rib of each of them with that li", "9": "ttle puff. We could not help asking if their lifechart was changed. \u201cYes, entirely. Some have gained years, some have lost them.", "10": " Some few will profit in various ways by the change, but only that few.\u201d We did not ask if we had brought poor Fischer's luck to", "11": " any of them. We did not wish to know. We fully believed in Satan's desire to do us kindnesses, but we were losing confidence in", "12": " his judgment. It was at this time that our growing anxiety to have him look over our lifecharts and suggest improvements began ", "13": "to fade out and give place to other interests. For a day or two the whole village was a chattering turmoil over Frau Brandt's ca", "14": "se and over the mysterious calamity that had overtaken the mob, and at her trial the place was crowded. She was easily convicted", "15": " of her blasphemies, for she uttered those terrible words again and said she would not take them back. When warned that she was ", "16": "imperiling her life, she said they could take it in welcome, she did not want it, she would rather live with the professional de", "17": "vils in perdition than with these imitators in the village. They accused her of breaking all those ribs by witchcraft, and asked", "18": " her if she was not a witch? She answered scornfully: \u201cNo. If I had that power would any of you holy hypocrites be alive five mi", "19": "nutes? No; I would strike you all dead. Pronounce your sentence and let me go; I am tired of your society.\u201d So they found her gu", "20": "ilty, and she was excommunicated and cut off from the joys of heaven and doomed to the fires of hell; then she was clothed in a ", "21": "coarse robe and delivered to the secular arm, and conducted to the marketplace, the bell solemnly tolling the while. We saw her ", "22": "chained to the stake, and saw the first film of blue smoke rise on the still air. Then her hard face softened, and she looked up", "23": "on the packed crowd in front of her and said, with gentleness: \u201cWe played together once, in longagone days when we were innocent", "24": " little creatures. For the sake of that, I forgive you.\u201d We went away then, and did not see the fires consume her, but we heard ", "25": "the shrieks, although we put our fingers in our ears. When they ceased we knew she was in heaven, notwithstanding the excommunic", "26": "ation; and we were glad of her death and not sorry that we had brought it about. One day, a little while after this, Satan appea", "27": "red again. We were always watching out for him, for life was never very stagnant when he was by. He came upon us at that place i", "28": "n the woods where we had first met him. Being boys, we wanted to be entertained; we asked him to do a show for us. \u201cVery well,\u201d ", "29": "he said; \u201cwould you like to see a history of the progress of the human race?its development of that product which it calls civil", "30": "ization?\u201d We said we should. So, with a thought, he turned the place into the Garden of Eden, and we saw Abel praying by his alt", "31": "ar; then Cain came walking toward him with his club, and did not seem to see us, and would have stepped on my foot if I had not ", "32": "drawn it in. He spoke to his brother in a language which we did not understand; then he grew violent and threatening, and we kne", "33": "w what was going to happen, and turned away our heads for the moment; but we heard the crash of the blows and heard the shrieks ", "34": "and the groans; then there was silence, and we saw Abel lying in his blood and gasping out his life, and Cain standing over him ", "35": "and looking down at him, vengeful and unrepentant. Then the vision vanished, and was followed by a long series of unknown wars, ", "36": "murders, and massacres. Next we had the Flood, and the Ark tossing around in the stormy waters, with lofty mountains in the dist", "37": "ance showing veiled and dim through the rain. Satan said: \u201cThe progress of your race was not satisfactory. It is to have another", "38": " chance now.\u201d The scene changed, and we saw Noah overcome with wine. Next, we had Sodom and Gomorrah, and \u201cthe attempt to discov", "39": "er two or three respectable persons there,\u201d as Satan described it. Next, Lot and his daughters in the cave. Next came the Hebrai", "40": "c wars, and we saw the victors massacre the survivors and their cattle, and save the young girls alive and distribute them aroun", "41": "d. Next we had Jael; and saw her slip into the tent and drive the nail into the temple of her sleeping guest; and we were so clo", "42": "se that when the blood gushed out it trickled in a little, red stream to our feet, and we could have stained our hands in it if ", "43": "we had wanted to. Next we had Egyptian wars, Greek wars, Roman wars, hideous drenchings of the earth with blood; and we saw the ", "44": "treacheries of the Romans toward the Carthaginians, and the sickening spectacle of the massacre of those brave people. Also we s", "45": "aw Caesar invade Britain\u201cnot that those barbarians had done him any harm, but because he wanted their land, and desired to confe", "46": "r the blessings of civilization upon their widows and orphans,\u201d as Satan explained. Next, Christianity was born. Then ages of Eu", "47": "rope passed in review before us, and we saw Christianity and Civilization march hand in hand through those ages, \u201cleaving famine", "48": " and death and desolation in their wake, and other signs of the progress of the human race,\u201d as Satan observed. And always we ha", "49": "d wars, and more wars, and still other warsall over Europe, all over the world. \u201cSometimes in the private interest of royal fami", "50": "lies,\u201d Satan said, \u201csometimes to crush a weak nation; but never a war started by the aggressor for any clean purposethere is no ", "51": "such war in the history of the race.\u201d \u201cNow,\u201d said Satan, \u201cyou have seen your progress down to the present, and you must confess ", "52": "that it is wonderfulin its way.

And Wilhelm could not explain why he ", "50": "only thought of the date on the coins at the last moment, instead of earlier; he said it just occurred to him, all of a sudden, ", "51": "like an inspiration, and he brought it right out without any hesitation, for, although he didn't examine the coins, he seemed, s", "52": "omehow, to know it was true.

They were much excited about this new piece of gossip, and they asked questi", "4": "ons, so as to get at a full understanding of it. They asked what a picture was, and the cat explained. \u201cIt is a flat thing,\u201d he ", "5": "said; \u201cwonderfully flat, marvelously flat, enchantingly flat and elegant. And, oh, so beautiful!\u201d That excited them almost to a ", "6": "frenzy, and they said they would give the world to see it.

Then the", "8": " cow asked: \u201cWhat is a mirror?\u201d \u201cIt is a hole in the wall,\u201d said the cat. \u201cYou look in it, and there you see the picture, and it", "9": " is so dainty and charming and ethereal and inspiring in its unimaginable beauty that your head turns round and round, and you a", "10": "lmost swoon with ecstasy.\u201d The ass had not said anything as yet; he now began to throw doubts.

Then the animals assailed the ass for spoiling what could possib", "15": "ly have been a pleasure to them, on a mere suspicion that the picture was not beautiful, without any evidence that such was the ", "16": "case. The ass was not troubled; he was calm, and said there was one way to find out who was in the right, himself or the cat: he", "17": " would go and look in that hole, and come back and tell what he found there. The animals felt relieved and grateful, and asked h", "18": "im to go at oncewhich he did. But he did not know where he ought to stand; and so, through error, he stood between the picture a", "19": "nd the mirror. The result was that the picture had no chance, and didn't show up.

When the dogs treed a squirrel, the squirrel would scamper aloft and run out on a limb and flatten himself along", "38": " it, hoping to make himself invisible in that wayand not quite succeeding. You could see his wee little ears sticking up. You co", "39": "uldn't see his nose, but you knew where it was. Then the hunter, despising a \u201crest\u201d for his rifle, stood up and took offhand aim", "40": " at the limb and sent a bullet into it immediately under the squirrel's nose, and down tumbled the animal, unwounded, but uncons", "41": "cious; the dogs gave him a shake and he was dead.

In the first faint gray of the dawn the stately wild turkeys would be stalking around in", "44": " great flocks, and ready to be sociable and answer invitations to come and converse with other excursionists of their kind. The ", "45": "hunter concealed himself and imitated the turkeycall by sucking the air through the legbone of a turkey which had previously ans", "46": "wered a call like that and lived only just long enough to regret it.

And now for the first time Mr. McWilliams showed feeling. Whenever I perceive this sign on this man's dial, I comprehend", "23": " it, and lapse into silence, and give him opportunity to unload his heart. Said he, with but illcontrolled emotion: \u201cI do not go", "24": " one single cent on burglar alarms, Mr. Twainnot a single centand I will tell you why. When we were finishing our house, we foun", "25": "d we had a little cash left over, on account of the plumber not knowing it. I was for enlightening the heathen with it, for I wa", "26": "s always unaccountably down on the heathen somehow; but Mrs. McWilliams said no, let's have a burglar alarm. I agreed to this co", "27": "mpromise. I will explain that whenever I want a thing, and Mrs. McWilliams wants another thing, and we decide upon the thing tha", "28": "t Mrs. McWilliams wantsas we always doshe calls that a compromise. Very well: the man came up from New York and put in the alarm", "29": ", and charged three hundred and twentyfive dollars for it, and said we could sleep without uneasiness now. So we did for awhiles", "30": "ay a month. Then one night we smelled smoke, and I was advised to get up and see what the matter was. I lit a candle, and starte", "31": "d toward the stairs, and met a burglar coming out of a room with a basket of tinware, which he had mistaken for solid silver in ", "32": "the dark. He was smoking a pipe. I said, 'My friend, we do not allow smoking in this room.' He said he was a stranger, and could", "33": " not be expected to know the rules of the house: said he had been in many houses just as good as this one, and it had never been", "34": " objected to before. He added that as far as his experience went, such rules had never been considered to apply to burglars, any", "35": "way. \u201cI said: 'Smoke along, then, if it is the custom, though I think that the conceding of a privilege to a burglar which is de", "36": "nied to a bishop is a conspicuous sign of the looseness of the times. But waiving all that, what business have you to be enterin", "37": "g this house in this furtive and clandestine way, without ringing the burglar alarm?' \u201cHe looked confused and ashamed, and said,", "38": " with embarrassment: 'I beg a thousand pardons. I did not know you had a burglar alarm, else I would have rung it. I beg you wil", "39": "l not mention it where my parents may hear of it, for they are old and feeble, and such a seemingly wanton breach of the hallowe", "40": "d conventionalities of our Christian civilization might all too rudely sunder the frail bridge which hangs darkling between the ", "41": "pale and evanescent present and the solemn great deeps of the eternities. May I trouble you for a match?' \u201cI said: 'Your sentime", "42": "nts do you honor, but if you will allow me to say it, metaphor is not your best hold. Spare your thigh; this kind light only on ", "43": "the box, and seldom there, in fact, if my experience may be trusted. But to return to business: how did you get in here?' \u201c'Thro", "44": "ugh a secondstory window.' \u201cIt was even so. I redeemed the tinware at pawnbroker's rates, less cost of advertising, bade the bur", "45": "glar goodnight, closed the window after him, and retired to headquarters to report. Next morning we sent for the burglaralarm ma", "46": "n, and he came up and explained that the reason the alarm did not 'go off' was that no part of the house but the first floor was", "47": " attached to the alarm. This was simply idiotic; one might as well have no armor on at all in battle as to have it only on his l", "48": "egs. The expert now put the whole second story on the alarm, charged three hundred dollars for it, and went his way. By and by, ", "49": "one night, I found a burglar in the third story, about to start down a ladder with a lot of miscellaneous property. My first imp", "50": "ulse was to crack his head with a billiard cue; but my second was to refrain from this attention, because he was between me and ", "51": "the cue rack. The second impulse was plainly the soundest, so I refrained, and proceeded to compromise. I redeemed the property ", "52": "at former rates, after deducting ten per cent. for use of ladder, it being my ladder, and, next day we sent down for the expert ", "53": "once more, and had the third story attached to the alarm, for three hundred dollars. \u201cBy this time the 'annunciator' had grown t", "54": "o formidable dimensions. It had fortyseven tags on it, marked with the names of the various rooms and chimneys, and it occupied ", "55": "the space of an ordinary wardrobe. The gong was the size of a washbowl, and was placed above the head of our bed. There was a wi", "56": "re from the house to the coachman's quarters in the stable, and a noble gong alongside his pillow. \u201cWe should have been comforta", "57": "ble now but for one defect.

In solid fact, there is no clamor that is even remotely com", "61": "parable to the dire clamor which that gong makes. Well, this catastrophe happened every morning regularly at five o'clock, and l", "62": "ost us three hours sleep; for, mind you, when that thing wakes you, it doesn't merely wake you in spots; it wakes you all over, ", "63": "conscience and all, and you are good for eighteen hours of wideawakeness subsequentlyeighteen hours of the very most inconceivab", "64": "le wideawakeness that you ever experienced in your life.

T", "18": "hat worked first rate, and a season of peace ensued, during which we got to inviting company once more and enjoying life. \u201cBut b", "19": "y and by the irrepressible alarm invented a new kink.

I seized my shotgun, and stood timing the coachman whilst that", "22": " appalling buzzing went on. I knew that his gong had flung him out, too, and that he would be along with his gun as soon as he c", "23": "ould jump into his clothes. When I judged that the time was ripe, I crept to the room next the nursery, glanced through the wind", "24": "ow, and saw the dim outline of the coachman in the yard below, standing at presentarms and waiting for a chance. Then I hopped i", "25": "nto the nursery and fired, and in the same instant the coachman fired at the red flash of my gun. Both of us were successful; I ", "26": "crippled a nurse, and he shot off all my back hair. We turned up the gas, and telephoned for a surgeon.

The alarm firm said that wha", "47": "t we needed now was to have her put in rightwith their new patent springs in the windows to make false alarms impossible, and th", "48": "eir new patent clock attached to take off and put on the alarm morning and night without human assistance. That seemed a good sc", "49": "heme. They promised to have the whole thing finished in ten days. They began work, and we left for the summer.

When we returned", "51": " in the fall, the house was as empty as a beer closet in premises where painters have been at work. We refurnished, and then sen", "52": "t down to hurry up the expert. He came up and finished the job, and said: 'Now this clock is set to put on the alarm every night", "53": " at 10, and take it off every morning at 5:45. All you've got to do is to wind her up every week, and then leave her aloneshe wi", "54": "ll take care of the alarm herself.' \u201cAfter that we had a most tranquil season during three months. The bill was prodigious, of c", "55": "ourse, and I had said I would not pay it until the new machinery had proved itself to be flawless. The time stipulated was three", "56": " months. So I paid the bill, and the very next day the alarm went to buzzing like ten thousand bee swarms at ten o'clock in the ", "57": "morning. I turned the hands around twelve hours, according to instructions, and this took off the alarm; but there was another h", "58": "itch at night, and I had to set her ahead twelve hours once more to get her to put the alarm on again.

They ", "16": "had not approached from the distance but had started quite near by; someone must therefore have stepped from out of the shadow o", "17": "f the house opposite. Had he been waiting there spying on me? The steps became hurried, passed me, crossed the street. A dark sh", "18": "ape hugged the wall under the recess of a door. No bell was rung. I stopped for an instant: the incertitude of the past few week", "19": "s reappeared. The knowledge of being watched, pursued, the torture of being deprived of my freedom, made me catch my breath. The", "20": " threat had followed me so long, appearing and disappearing in turn, menacing me from under every porch, from every dark corner.", "21": " Should I fly from it?

The lorry di", "30": "sappeared, but we could hear his voice shouting something in Russian.

Suddenly everything became dark, and sootladen s", "42": "moke filled the compartment. Before I grasped what it was the chance had passed. A tunnel.... If I had thought of it earlier I m", "43": "ight have.... Nonsense, I should have broken my neck. The train stopped: we were on the open track. There was a deep ditch along", "44": " the embankment\u2014I might get off here. The passengers crowded to the windows and someone shouted from outside: \u201cIt\u2019s not likely t", "45": "hat the train will be allowed to enter Balassagyarmat. The Czechs are shelling the station.\u201d I made myself as small as possible ", "46": "in my corner. It was nonsense, all nonsense.... Then there was another station. Red soldiers everywhere. I saw the man in the sh", "47": "ort fur coat again; he was running about the station, then stopped and stared towards the place where we had pulled up in the op", "48": "en. He shook his head and seemed to be swearing. Was he looking for me? At all events he jumped back into the train. Night was n", "49": "ow falling and we had to wait a long time in the station, for the enginedriver had gone to an inn for his supper. A passenger sa", "50": "id that they had sent for him but that he had replied: \u201cLet them get up steam themselves.\u201d It was night before we started again,", "51": " and rain began to fall. Slowly light began to stream towards us through the clammy darkness, and people in the compartment got ", "52": "ready to get out. A voice said \u201cBalassagyarmat.\u201d I stood near the door, opened it suddenly, threw out my bag and jumped. The oth", "53": "er doors opened a good deal later, when I was already running through the exit towards the town. Nobody asked me for my ticket, ", "54": "or took any notice of me. I reached a paling, overshadowed by a huge walnut tree, leant against it, and waited till everybody ha", "55": "d passed, people and carriages. For an instant I caught sight of the man in the short fur coat going towards the town. Then the ", "56": "lights of the station went out, and I was alone in the dark at the foot of the tree. It was over! And yet the terror remained. I", "57": " still felt that strange will searching for me in the dark, saw the hand industriously groping for me, missing me over and over ", "58": "again. It had not yet found me, but perhaps later on.... Instinctively I ducked in my hidingplace. The hand missed me. It had mi", "59": "ssed me till now, but every time it seemed to get nearer its goal.

Every time the h", "61": "and had been nearer. One lucky movement and it would have got me. It had been so yesterday, it might be so tomorrow, but at any ", "62": "rate it had missed me today and I was still free. I looked round and my eyes became accustomed to the dark. Where was I to go? A", "63": " broad street overshadowed by trees led from the station to the town. Should I follow that? I retained a confused memory of the ", "64": "instructions Elisabeth K\u00e1llay had given me. Soldiers came towards me, then a few people, at last a little boy. I resolved to con"}, "125": {"1": "fide in the latter. \u201cWill you help me to carry my bag?\u201d The boy caught hold of it but it was too heavy for him, so we carried it", "2": " together. After all, that had not been my object. What I really wanted was to find the house of Alad\u00e1r Husz\u00e1r. The boy was not ", "3": "quite sure of it, but he led bravely on through the rain. We left gardens and small villas behind us and came in sight of a chur", "4": "ch by dripping trees and a soaking sandy road. A woman was standing in one of the doorways: She put us right: \u201cThe end of the to", "5": "wn, the last house but one.\u201d New anxieties now took hold of me: up till the present I had only worried about finding my way, and", "6": " now that I had found it, it occurred to me that they might have left the town. Alad\u00e1r Husz\u00e1r had the reputation of being a coun", "7": "terrevolutionary and was suspected by the new power. His wife was the president of the county branch of the Federation of Hungar", "8": "ian Women, and she had been attacked by the local SocialistCommunist papers. The boy passed through an iron gate and we went up ", "9": "a few steps till we came to a door with glass panes. I was very nervous. I was going to ask for shelter from people who themselv", "10": "es were threatened. I felt painfully ashamed of myself. \u201cThere is the bell!\u201d the boy said. Yet I still hesitated. Only those who", "11": " have stood on a stranger\u2019s threshold, doubting the quality of their welcome, can appreciate my feelings. The boy deposited the ", "12": "bag, asked for his money and ran away. The ringing of the bell broke the silence of the house, and the sudden sound frightened m", "13": "e. I imagined the uneasiness caused to those within. In these times even a knock in broad daylight is enough to cause alarm. Rap", "14": "id steps approached from the further end of the long corridor and a frightened maid asked me what I wanted. \u201cWill you say that E", "15": "lisabeth F\u00f6ldv\u00e1ry has arrived?\u201d Doors opened; there was a ray of light, and in its beam a fine setter ran barking towards me, fo", "16": "llowed by Alad\u00e1r Husz\u00e1r.

For an instant he looked at me searchingly: \u201cElisabeth F\u00f6ldv\u00e1ry?...\u201d By now we were alon", "18": "e, and I whispered my real name to him. He jerked his head in surprise. \u201cWe were told yesterday that you had escaped to Switzerl", "19": "and.\u201d \u201cHelp me to get across the Ipoly!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry, we will discuss it; now come inside quickly.\u201d He picked up my bag an", "20": "d we went into the house as if we were old friends.

Her face was ", "23": "cold and her features seemed nearly rigid. I felt anxious: What was she going to say? She seemed neither astonished nor nervous,", "24": " though she had lately been told I had escaped abroad, and she behaved as if it had been the most natural thing in the world for", "25": " a stranger wanted by the police to drop in on them in the middle of the night.

My dress was h", "30": "anging on me and my hands trembled. The children, two little girls and a boy, came in. They were told I was a relation of theirs", "31": ". In a few minutes I watched them being put to bed. Outside, the rain was falling and the world was full of Red soldiers, detect", "32": "ives, hatred, misery, dirt, fear, humiliation.

The electric lights went out: it was eleven o\u2019", "34": "clock. The house became quiet. We stayed up for a time round a single candle. Words were unnecessary between us.

CHAPTER VI BALASSAGYARMAT, _April 17th_. I thought my excitements had come to an end, but ill", "43": "fortune has looked me in the face again. It has just glanced at me, but has not seized me yet. And now, how long shall I be here", "44": "? Shall I be driven away, or will this be the scene of my capture? I can no longer see the end of my road. I never seem to know ", "45": "when I shall be able to put a fullstop at the end of my sentence. It makes no difference. If my diary must remain a fragment, fr", "46": "agments can bear witness. Every clod plays its part in a landslide, and there is some fragment of the great tragedy in every par", "47": "ticle that composes it. When I woke this morning it took me a long time to realise where I was. The daylight was reflected from ", "48": "the glass doors of a bookcase, and I heard the sound of a reedflute. The primitive melodies of the cowherd mingled with the tram", "49": "pling of the cattle. But where was I? Something gripped my heart and forced the truth from it. A fugitive, an outlaw! I looked o", "50": "ut of the window: cows were coming down the little street on the outskirts of the town. Everything was different from my surroun", "51": "dings of yesterday. The house opposite was indifferently, ignorantly looking at its reflection in the puddles. Somewhere in that", "52": " direction the railway station must lie, and the road to it crosses the square in front of the town hall. I had a good idea what", "53": " this square must be like. A big market with arcades, an old fountain, the old town hall with its tower.... Yes, it must be like", "54": " that. \u201cGood morning!\u201d The children\u2019s clear voices called me from the next room. Breakfast was ready on a glasscovered verandah,", "55": " opening on to the back garden. The old flowerbed under the sprouting ornamental trees had been replaced by vegetables, but shru", "56": "bs remained, and beyond the fence were trees, shingled roofs, little gardens. Aspen trees, willows and graceful, slender poplars", "57": " were reflected from a soft, brilliant mirror\u2014the Ipoly in flood. On the other side of the river were the vineyards where the Cz", "58": "echs were encamped. For two months their guns have been trained on the town. I mentioned my notes; Husz\u00e1r gave me some paper and", "59": " a pencil. Then the front door bell rang. Who could it be? It was unusual to have visitors at that hour. Gregory, the faithful o", "60": "ld coachman, put his head in. \u201cTwo armed Reds are here!\u201d he exclaimed. I clasped my hands in terror. Mrs. Husz\u00e1r turned white to", "61": " the lips: \u201cWhat are we to do if they are after you? The town is full of detectives.\u201d She went out and when she came back she wa", "62": "s laughing. \u201cI was never so frightened in my life. They asked me: \u2018Does Comrade Husz\u00e1r live here?\u2019 Then one of them made an awfu", "63": "l face and added: \u2018We have been informed that there is a\u2014er\u2014library in the house.\u2019 I really thought they had found you. And all ", "64": "they had discovered was our library!\u201d It was a good library; I spent a long time among its volumes, and found them representativ"}, "126": {"1": "e of Hungarian history and of the development of Socialism. I determined to study. \u201cYou\u2019d better write a book,\u201d said Mrs. Husz\u00e1r", "2": ". \u201cWhen we have got over these times, let people know what we have gone through.\u201d *       *       *       *       * _April 18th.", "3": "_ Good Friday. At the feet of Christ\u2019s cross, under the black sky, on the Red land, Hungary has been crucified among the nations", "4": ". We hoped that an attack on the town would be delivered this night by the Czechs. It sounds sheer madness, and yet it was so. I", "5": "t was different last year, when K\u00e1rolyi had opened our frontiers and our predatory neighbours could walk in undisturbed on our u", "6": "nconscious, shackled towns.

And this day all those who are Hungarians in the republic of the Jewish tyrants are waiting in suspens", "8": "e. *       *       *       *       * _April 19th._ The night has passed. At dawn only a few stray rifle bullets whistled over an", "9": "d into the Ipoly, disturbing the surface of the water for a moment, but the river soon resumed its smoothness and everything is ", "10": "now as it was yesterday. There is no change, and our deliverers still hesitate. But within our shamefully constricted frontiers ", "11": "the outlines of the picture become clear, and the undermining of society goes on with devilish speed. The newspapers which reach", "12": "ed us this day publish an incredible order\u2014the sixtysecond within three weeks. \u201cThe Revolutionary Cabinet considers it its duty ", "13": "to revise the procedure of such criminal proceedings as have been instituted before the proclamation of the Soviet, so as to sav", "14": "e from punishment those Proletarians who were called before the tribunals by the old order in the interest of capitalism alone, ", "15": "and, on the other hand, to punish severely, those who have sinned against the working Proletarians.\u201d This order is without prece", "16": "dent in the history of human law. It destroys at a blow the progress of centuries. It endows the privileged and only recognised ", "17": "class, the Proletarians, with the monopoly of crime. Even in the administration of justice, Bolshevism stands on the basis of cl", "18": "ass hatred and serves the class war. If the Proletarian has robbed a member of the middle classes, he cannot be punished; if he ", "19": "has murdered a bourgeois, he cannot be condemned, because his actions were simply acts of selfdefence against the tyranny of cap", "20": "italism. And after abolishing crime as such, it proceeds to the destruction of its traces. All records are burnt in stacks, and ", "21": "the files of criminal proceedings which might involve those in power today are made away with. B\u00e9la Kun embezzled the funds of a", "22": " workmen\u2019s benevolent society. The papers of the prosecution have been burnt and the leader of the Soviet has purged his honour ", "23": "in the ashes. Once the Roman Empire of the West, Byzantium, Friul, Saxony, all paid tribute to the old Hungary. The profiles of ", "24": "conquered Emperors, of C\u00e6sars and of Princes, minted in gold, flowed into the Danubian province of Hungary, and later on the har", "25": "vests of peace sent their surplus into the treasury of the land, the fruits of valour and of work. Today the ruling power burgle", "26": "s safes. Protected by its ordinances, it steals jewels, gold and precious stones, proclaiming, \u201cNo compensation is due for prope", "27": "rty delivered to the State.\u201d Everything that can be exchanged for foreign gold is confiscated. Even stamp collections which are ", "28": "worth more than two thousand crowns are taken, the happiness of little schoolboys, the hobby of collectors. The head of the Dire", "29": "ctorium of Balassagyarmat returned yesterday from Budapest. Husz\u00e1r heard him relating proudly in the street that he had spoken w", "30": "ith B\u00e9la Kun himself. The position of the Soviet Republic has been considerably strengthened abroad and at home, and the economi", "31": "c conditions are excellent. B\u00e9la Kun has declared that he has such a reserve in jewels, pearls, medals and art treasures that th", "32": "ere was no bourgeois Government in the world that could compete with him. Negotiations are on foot for the disposal, in Holland,", "33": " of these treasures. Husz\u00e1r\u2019s next statement filled me with shame and anger. B\u00e9la Kun was bargaining with foreign antiquaries fo", "34": "r the sale of the Holy Hungarian Crown! It is said they offered him 170,000 crowns for it. The stones are secondrate, the gold i", "35": "s thin, there is just the historical value left. 170,000 crowns for the past glories of the Kings of Hungary! That is their valu", "36": "e today. The Cabinet is still expectant: will anybody bid any more? And if one day there is a higher bidder, B\u00e9la Kun and Sz\u00e1mue", "37": "lly, Comrade Landler and the others, will open the ironbound chest in the Coronation Chapel, lean over it, finger it, and the Je", "38": "ws will take Europe\u2019s oldest royal crown[1] to the auction room. Will they have time to do it? I thought of what the president o", "39": "f the Balassagyarmat Directorate had said. They all talk as if they were to last for ever. Meanwhile, the other bank of the Ipol", "40": "y, the hill with the vineyards, keeps silent. If things were to remain like this for long! The idea tortures me incessantly and ", "41": "forces me to think of my unhappy position. My hosts are hospitable, kind, touchingly so, but have I the right to accept their ge", "42": "nerosity? Alad\u00e1r Husz\u00e1r has given up his office, he declines to serve the Soviet. His wife\u2019s jewels have been seized, they have ", "43": "no food coupons. What is consumed today cannot be replaced tomorrow. Every gift means a privation for them. And what if I should", "44": " be found and arrested in their house! There are ten years of penal servitude in store for those who shelter me. I must do somet", "45": "hing. If there is no change presently I shall have to go. Have the waters of the Ipoly receded during the night? Perhaps the Cze", "46": "chs are not guarding the banks any longer? Perhaps the bridge is open? \u201cLet us wait,\u201d said Mrs. Husz\u00e1r. \u201cWe confidently expect a", "47": "n attack tonight, and that would save you.\u201d \u201cLet us go and have a look. Maybe....\u201d We walked slowly along the bank of the river.", "48": " The air was clear and fresh and the wind rippled the flooded waters. A woman came along the road with a hamper over her arm and", "49": " greeted us. \u201cDo you come from the other bank?\u201d The woman nodded: \u201cWe have a little field over there. But in future, from today,", "50": " the Czechs have refused to let me pass. They shoot at anyone who approaches the bridge. They are preparing something.\u201d As she p", "51": "assed on we looked at each other and then towards the bridge. That road then existed no longer.

The tree which had fallen across the river near the gardens, the l", "53": "iving bridge over which fugitives had quite recently crawled across, is now under water in midstream. The Ipoly is like a sea. T", "54": "he silver stream is flowing over the green velvet of the inundated fields and meadows. The willows on the banks draw a veil over", "55": " the silver. Against the lovely blue background of the distant hills, the poplars look like rows of furled flags. All nature see", "56": "ms in ecstasy. Birds sing in the dazzling sunshine.

HUCKLEBERRY FINN Scene: The Mississippi Valley Time: Forty to fifty years ago CHAPTER I. You do", "6": "n\u2019t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain\u2019t no matter. That book ", "7": "was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. Th", "8": "at is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt P", "9": "olly\u2014Tom\u2019s Aunt Polly, she is\u2014and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with ", "10": "some stretchers, as I said before. Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid i", "11": "n the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece\u2014all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled u", "12": "p. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round\u2014more t", "13": "han a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was ", "14": "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I c", "15": "ouldn\u2019t stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Saw", "16": "yer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be re", "17": "spectable. So I went back. The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, ", "18": "too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn\u2019t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and", "19": " feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. ", "20": "When you got to the table you couldn\u2019t go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a", "21": " little over the victuals, though there warn\u2019t really anything the matter with them,\u2014that is, nothing only everything was cooked", "22": " by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the thing", "23": "s go better. After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out a", "24": "ll about him; but byandby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn\u2019t care no more about ", "25": "him, because I don\u2019t take no stock in dead people. Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn\u2019", "26": "t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn\u2019t clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people", "27": ". They get down on a thing when they don\u2019t know nothing about it. Here she was abothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, ", "28": "and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And", "29": " she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself. Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old m", "30": "aid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spellingbook. She worked me middling hard ", "31": "for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn\u2019t stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, an", "32": "d I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, \u201cDon\u2019t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t scrunch up like that, Huckleberr", "33": "y\u2014set up straight;\u201d and pretty soon she would say, \u201cDon\u2019t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry\u2014why don\u2019t you try to behave?\u201d T", "34": "hen she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn\u2019t mean no harm. All I wan", "35": "ted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn\u2019t particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wo", "36": "uldn\u2019t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn\u2019t see no advantage in goi", "37": "ng where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and", "38": " wouldn\u2019t do no good. Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would h", "39": "ave to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn\u2019t think much of it. But I never ", "40": "said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that,", "41": " because I wanted him and me to be together. Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. Byandby they ", "42": "fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put ", "43": "it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn\u2019t no use. I felt", "44": " so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard", "45": " an owl, away off, whowhooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to d", "46": "ie; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn\u2019t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run", "47": " over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that\u2019", "48": "s on its mind and can\u2019t make itself understood, and so can\u2019t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night gr", "49": "ieving. I got so downhearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I ", "50": "flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn\u2019t need anybody to tell me that", "51": " that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and", "52": " turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thr", "53": "ead to keep witches away. But I hadn\u2019t no confidence. You do that when you\u2019ve lost a horseshoe that you\u2019ve found, instead of nai", "54": "ling it up over the door, but I hadn\u2019t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you\u2019d killed a spider. I ", "55": "set down again, ashaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the wido", "56": "w wouldn\u2019t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom\u2014boom\u2014boom\u2014twelve licks; and all still ag", "57": "ain\u2014stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees\u2014something was a stirring. I set still ", "58": "and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a \u201c_meyow! meyow!_\u201d down there. That was good! Says I, \u201c_meyow! meyow!_\u201d as soft", "59": " as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and ", "60": "crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me. CHAPTER II. We went tiptoeing along a path am", "61": "ongst the trees back towards the end of the widow\u2019s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn\u2019t scrape our heads. When we ", "62": "was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson\u2019s big nigger, name", "63": "d Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stret", "64": "ched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says: \u201cWho dah?\u201d He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and sto"}, "172": {"1": "od right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn\u2019t a sound, and we a", "2": "ll there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn\u2019t scratch it; and then my ear begun to", "3": " itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I\u2019d die if I couldn\u2019t scratch. Well, I\u2019ve noticed that thing pl", "4": "enty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain\u2019t sleepy\u2014if you are anywhe", "5": "res where it won\u2019t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says: \u201cSay", "6": ", who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn\u2019 hear sumf\u2019n. Well, I know what I\u2019s gwyne to do: I\u2019s gwyne to set down here and", "7": " listen tell I hears it agin.\u201d So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretc", "8": "hed his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. B", "9": "ut I dasn\u2019t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to set", "10": " still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in ele", "11": "ven different places now. I reckoned I couldn\u2019t stand it more\u2019n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. J", "12": "ust then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore\u2014and then I was pretty soon comfortable again. Tom he made a sign to ", "13": "me\u2014kind of a little noise with his mouth\u2014and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispere", "14": "d to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they\u2019d find ou", "15": "t I warn\u2019t in. Then Tom said he hadn\u2019t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn\u2019t want him", "16": " to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid f", "17": "ive cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to", "18": " where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still", "19": " and lonesome. As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and byandby fetched up on the steep top o", "20": "f the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim\u2019s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and ", "21": "Jim stirred a little, but he didn\u2019t wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him al", "22": "l over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told", "23": " it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till byandby h", "24": "e said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddleboils. Jim was monstrous p", "25": "roud about it, and he got so he wouldn\u2019t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, an", "26": "d he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all ", "27": "over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was ", "28": "talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, \u201cHm! What you know \u2019bout witches?\u201d and that n", "29": "igger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that fivecenter piece round his neck with a string, and said it", "30": " was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he ", "31": "wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there ", "32": "and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that fivecenter piece; but they wouldn\u2019t touch it, because the devil had had", "33": " his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode b", "34": "y witches. Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four", "35": " lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village ", "36": "was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two ", "37": "or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the", "38": " big scar on the hillside, and went ashore. We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and t", "39": "hen showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our han", "40": "ds and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soo", "41": "n ducked under a wall where you wouldn\u2019t a noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of ro", "42": "om, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says: \u201cNow, we\u2019ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer\u2019", "43": "s Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.\u201d Everybody was willing. So Tom got ou", "44": "t a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of th", "45": "e secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family mus", "46": "t do it, and he mustn\u2019t eat and he mustn\u2019t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign", "47": " of the band. And nobody that didn\u2019t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it ag", "48": "ain he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his", "49": " carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again ", "50": "by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever. Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he ", "51": "got it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of piratebooks and robberbooks, and every gang that was hi", "52": "ghtoned had it. Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea,", "53": " so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says: \u201cHere\u2019s Huck Finn, he hain\u2019t got no family; what you going to do \u2019bo", "54": "ut him?\u201d \u201cWell, hain\u2019t he got a father?\u201d says Tom Sawyer. \u201cYes, he\u2019s got a father, but you can\u2019t never find him these days. He u", "55": "sed to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain\u2019t been seen in these parts for a year or more.\u201d They talked it over, ", "56": "and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn\u2019t be fa", "57": "ir and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of anything to do\u2014everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready ", "58": "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson\u2014they could kill her. Everybody said: \u201cOh, she\u2019ll d", "59": "o. That\u2019s all right. Huck can come in.\u201d Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark", "60": " on the paper. \u201cNow,\u201d says Ben Rogers, \u201cwhat\u2019s the line of business of this Gang?\u201d \u201cNothing only robbery and murder,\u201d Tom said. ", "61": "\u201cBut who are we going to rob?\u2014houses, or cattle, or\u2014\u201d \u201cStuff! stealing cattle and such things ain\u2019t robbery; it\u2019s burglary,\u201d say", "62": "s Tom Sawyer. \u201cWe ain\u2019t burglars. That ain\u2019t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with", "63": " masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\u201d \u201cMust we always kill the people?\u201d \u201cOh, certainly. It\u2019s best. S", "64": "ome authorities think different, but mostly it\u2019s considered best to kill them\u2014except some that you bring to the cave here, and k"}, "173": {"1": "eep them till they\u2019re ransomed.\u201d \u201cRansomed? What\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s what they do. I\u2019ve seen it in books; and so ", "2": "of course that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do.\u201d \u201cBut how can we do it if we don\u2019t know what it is?\u201d \u201cWhy, blame it all, we\u2019ve _got_ to d", "3": "o it. Don\u2019t I tell you it\u2019s in the books? Do you want to go to doing different from what\u2019s in the books, and get things all mudd", "4": "led up?\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don\u2019", "5": "t know how to do it to them?\u2014that\u2019s the thing _I_ want to get at. Now, what do you _reckon_ it is?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. But per", "6": "\u2019aps if we keep them till they\u2019re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they\u2019re dead.\u201d \u201cNow, that\u2019s something _like_. That\u2019l", "7": "l answer. Why couldn\u2019t you said that before? We\u2019ll keep them till they\u2019re ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they\u2019ll be, to", "8": "o\u2014eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.\u201d \u201cHow you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there\u2019s a guard ", "9": "over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?\u201d \u201cA guard! Well, that _is_ good. So somebody\u2019s got to set up all night a", "10": "nd never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that\u2019s foolishness. Why can\u2019t a body take a club and ransom them as so", "11": "on as they get here?\u201d \u201cBecause it ain\u2019t in the books so\u2014that\u2019s why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don\u2019t ", "12": "you?\u2014that\u2019s the idea.

He said he\u2019d cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn\u2019t raise some money for him. I borrowed three doll", "61": "ars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got drunk, and went ablowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on; and h", "62": "e kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, an", "63": "d jailed him again for a week. But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he\u2019d make it warm for _him_. Whe", "64": "n he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of him. So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean an"}, "176": {"1": "d nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old pie to him, so to speak. And after supp", "2": "er he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he\u2019d been a fool, and fooled away his life", "3": "; but now he was agoing to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn\u2019t be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help hi", "4": "m and not look down on him. The judge said he could hug him for them words; so _he_ cried, and his wife she cried again; pap sai", "5": "d he\u2019d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the judge said he believed it. The old man said that what a man", "6": " wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried again.

There\u2019s a hand that was t", "8": "he hand of a hog; but it ain\u2019t so no more; it\u2019s the hand of a man that\u2019s started in on a new life, and\u2019ll die before he\u2019ll go ba", "9": "ck.

The judge\u2019s wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a pledge\u2014made his mark. The judge s", "11": "aid it was the holiest time on record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was the", "12": " spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and ", "13": "traded his new coat for a jug of fortyrod, and clumb back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out aga", "14": "in, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody", "15": " found him after sunup. And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it. ", "16": "The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn\u2019t know no", "17": " other way. CHAPTER VI. Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts", "18": " to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of times and thrashed ", "19": "me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time. I didn\u2019t want to go to school much before", "20": ", but I reckoned I\u2019d go now to spite pap. That law trial was a slow business\u2014appeared like they warn\u2019t ever going to get started", "21": " on it; so every now and then I\u2019d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every ", "22": "time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jai", "23": "led. He was just suited\u2014this kind of thing was right in his line. He got to hanging around the widow\u2019s too much and so she told ", "24": "him at last that if he didn\u2019t quit using around there she would make trouble for him. Well, _wasn\u2019t_ he mad? He said he would sh", "25": "ow who was Huck Finn\u2019s boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about thre", "26": "e mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn\u2019t no houses but an old log hut in a ", "27": "place where the timber was so thick you couldn\u2019t find it if you didn\u2019t know where it was. He kept me with him all the time, and ", "28": "I never got a chance to run off. We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights", "29": ". He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little while he lock", "30": "ed me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got", "31": " drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where I was byandby, and she sent a man over to try to get ho", "32": "ld of me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn\u2019t long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it\u2014a", "33": "ll but the cowhide part. It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and fishing, and no books nor st", "34": "udy. Two months or more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn\u2019t see how I\u2019d ever got to like it so w", "35": "ell at the widow\u2019s, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bot", "36": "hering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time. I didn\u2019t want to go back no more. I had stopped cussin", "37": "g, because the widow didn\u2019t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn\u2019t no objections. It was pretty good times up in", "38": " the woods there, take it all around. But byandby pap got too handy with his hick\u2019ry, and I couldn\u2019t stand it. I was all over we", "39": "lts. He got to going away so much, too, and locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful lonesom", "40": "e. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn\u2019t ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix up som", "41": "e way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn\u2019t find no way. There warn\u2019t a window to it ", "42": "big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn\u2019t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap ", "43": "was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much ", "44": "as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I f", "45": "ound something at last; I found an old rusty woodsaw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of t", "46": "he roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horseblanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin beh", "47": "ind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the", "48": " blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out\u2014big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job", "49": ", but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap\u2019s gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped th", "50": "e blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in. Pap warn\u2019t in a good humor\u2014so he was his natural self. He said he was dow", "51": "n town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got ", "52": "started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said peo", "53": "ple allowed there\u2019d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would", "54": " win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn\u2019t want to go back to the widow\u2019s any more and be so cramped up and", "55": " sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then ", "56": "cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn\u2019t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all ", "57": "round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn\u2019t know the names of, and so called them what\u2019shisname when he got", "58": " to them, and went right along with his cussing. He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch out, and ", "59": "if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till ", "60": "they dropped and they couldn\u2019t find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn\u2019t stay on h", "61": "and till he got that chance. The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fiftypound sack of", "62": " corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a fourgallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, bes", "63": "ides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I recko", "64": "ned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn\u2019t stay in one place,"}, "177": {"1": " but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the o", "2": "ld man nor the widow couldn\u2019t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and ", "3": "I reckoned he would. I got so full of it I didn\u2019t notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I", "4": " was asleep or drownded. I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While I was cooking supper the old ma", "5": "n took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutte", "6": "r all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought he was Adam\u2014he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun to", "7": " work he most always went for the govment, this time he says: \u201cCall this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it\u2019s like.", "8": " Here\u2019s the law astanding ready to take a man\u2019s son away from him\u2014a man\u2019s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the ", "9": "anxiety and all the expense of raising.

Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio\u2014a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest", "20": " shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain\u2019t a man in that town that\u2019s got as fine clothes as what he had;", "21": " and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silverheaded cane\u2014the awfulest old grayheaded nabob in the State.

But when I got to shore pap wasn\u2019t in sight yet, an", "17": "d as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I", "18": "\u2019d hide her good, and then, \u2019stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I\u2019d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one", "19": " place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot. It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the o", "20": "ld man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man do", "21": "wn the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn\u2019t seen anything. When he got along I was hard at it t", "22": "aking up a \u201ctrot\u201d line. He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me s", "23": "o long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines and went home.", "24": " While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some w", "25": "ay to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off", "26": " before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn\u2019t see no way for a while, but byandby pap raised", "27": " up a minute to drink another barrel of water, and he says: \u201cAnother time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out, you", "28": " hear? That man warn\u2019t here for no good. I\u2019d a shot him. Next time you roust me out, you hear?\u201d Then he dropped down and went to", "29": " sleep again; but what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody won\u2019t thi", "30": "nk of following me. About twelve o\u2019clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots", "31": " of driftwood going by on the rise. Byandby along comes part of a log raft\u2014nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff a", "32": "nd towed it ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but ", "33": "that warn\u2019t pap\u2019s style. Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and to", "34": "ok the skiff, and started off towing the raft about halfpast three. I judged he wouldn\u2019t come back that night. I waited till I r", "35": "eckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that log again. Before he was t\u2019other side of the r", "36": "iver I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder. I took the sack of corn meal and too", "37": "k it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of ba", "38": "con; then the whiskyjug. I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucke", "39": "t and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the coffeepot. I took fishlines", "40": " and matches and other things\u2014everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn\u2019t any, ", "41": "only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done. I had w", "42": "ore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the", "43": " outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back in", "44": "to its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn\u2019t quite ", "45": "touch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn\u2019t know it was sawed, you wouldn\u2019t never notice it; and besides, this ", "46": "was the back of the cabin, and it warn\u2019t likely anybody would go fooling around there. It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I", "47": " hadn\u2019t left a track. I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the river. All safe. So I took the gun a", "48": "nd went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bott", "49": "oms after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp. I took the axe and smashed in the", "50": " door. I beat it and hacked it considerable adoing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked in", "51": "to his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it _was_ ground\u2014hard packed, and no b", "52": "oards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it\u2014all I could drag\u2014and I started it from the pig, and dragge", "53": "d it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see th", "54": "at something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind ", "55": "of business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that. Well, last I p", "56": "ulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took", "57": " up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn\u2019t drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dump", "58": "ed him into the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and f", "59": "etched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for ther", "60": "e warn\u2019t no knives and forks on the place\u2014pap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking. Then I carried the sack abo", "61": "ut a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and ful", "62": "l of rushes\u2014and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that ", "63": "went miles away, I don\u2019t know where, but it didn\u2019t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to t", "64": "he lake. I dropped pap\u2019s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the mea"}, "179": {"1": "l sack with a string, so it wouldn\u2019t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again. It was about dark now; so I droppe", "2": "d the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a willow;", "3": " then I took a bite to eat, and byandby laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they\u2019ll fol", "4": "low the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they\u2019ll follow that meal track to the la", "5": "ke and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won\u2019t ever h", "6": "unt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They\u2019ll soon get tired of that, and won\u2019t bother no more about me. All right; I ", "7": "can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson\u2019s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there", "8": ". And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson\u2019s Island\u2019s the place. I was pre", "9": "tty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn\u2019t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked", "10": " around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted t", "11": "he drift logs that went aslipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it lo", "12": "oked late, and _smelt_ late. You know what I mean\u2014I don\u2019t know the words to put it in. I took a good gap and a stretch, and was ", "13": "just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dul", "14": "l kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it\u2019s a still night. I peeped out through the willow bran", "15": "ches, and there it was\u2014a skiff, away across the water. I couldn\u2019t tell how many was in it. It kept acoming, and when it was abre", "16": "ast of me I see there warn\u2019t but one man in it. Think\u2019s I, maybe it\u2019s pap, though I warn\u2019t expecting him. He dropped below me wi", "17": "th the current, and byandby he came aswinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun ", "18": "and touched him. Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough\u2014and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars. I didn\u2019t lose no time. The next mi", "19": "nute I was aspinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quar", "20": "ter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people migh", "21": "t see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float. I laid t", "22": "here, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep w", "23": "hen you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! ", "24": "I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too\u2014every word of it. One man said it was getting towards t", "25": "he long days and the short nights now. T\u2019other one said _this_ warn\u2019t one of the short ones, he reckoned\u2014and then they laughed, ", "26": "and he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn\u2019t la", "27": "ugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone. The first fellow said he \u2019lowed to tell it to his old woman\u2014she woul", "28": "d think it was pretty good; but he said that warn\u2019t nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it was n", "29": "early three o\u2019clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn\u2019t wait more than about a week longer. After that the talk got further and furt", "30": "her away, and I couldn\u2019t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed ", "31": "a long ways off. I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson\u2019s Island, about two mile and a half down strea", "32": "m, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. T", "33": "here warn\u2019t any signs of the bar at the head\u2014it was all under water now. It didn\u2019t take me long to get there. I shot past the he", "34": "ad at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois s", "35": "hore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I ", "36": "made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside. I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked ", "37": "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights tw", "38": "inkling. A monstrous big lumberraft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched", "39": " it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \u201cStern oars, there! heave her head to s", "40": "tabboard!\u201d I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side. There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into th", "41": "e woods, and laid down for a nap before breakfast. CHAPTER VIII. The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after ", "42": "eight o\u2019clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and", "43": " satisfied. I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them", "44": ". There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about ", "45": "a little, showing there was a little breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly. I wa", "46": "s powerful lazy and comfortable\u2014didn\u2019t want to get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a d", "47": "eep sound of \u201cboom!\u201d away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped u", "48": "p, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up\u2014about abreast ", "49": "the ferry. And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the matter now. \u201cBoom!\u201d I see the w", "50": "hite smoke squirt out of the ferryboat\u2019s side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to", "51": " the top. I was pretty hungry, but it warn\u2019t going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set ther", "52": "e and watched the cannonsmoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer ", "53": "morning\u2014so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened", "54": " to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the drownded ca", "55": "rcass and stop there. So, says I, I\u2019ll keep a lookout, and if any of them\u2019s floating around after me I\u2019ll give them a show. I ch", "56": "anged to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn\u2019t disappointed. A big double loaf come along,", "57": " and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in ", "58": "the closest to the shore\u2014I knowed enough for that. But byandby along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug", "59": " and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was \u201cbaker\u2019s bread\u201d\u2014what the quality eat; none of your low", "60": "down cornpone. I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferryboat, and", "61": " very well satisfied. And then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this br", "62": "ead would find me, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain\u2019t no doubt but there is something in that thing\u2014that is, there", "63": "\u2019s something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don\u2019t work for me, and I reckon it don\u2019t work for only", "64": " just the right kind. I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The ferryboat was floating with the current,"}, "180": {"1": " and I allowed I\u2019d have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did", "2": ". When she\u2019d got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down be", "3": "hind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where the log forked I could peep through. Byandby she come along, and she drifte", "4": "d in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat. Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and ", "5": "Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody was talking", "6": " about the murder, but the captain broke in and says: \u201cLook sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he\u2019s was", "7": "hed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water\u2019s edge. I hope so, anyway.\u201d I didn\u2019t hope so. They all crowded up and ", "8": "leaned over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see them firstrate, but they co", "9": "uldn\u2019t see me. Then the captain sung out: \u201cStand away!\u201d and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef", "10": " with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone. If they\u2019d a had some bullets in, I reckon they\u2019d ", "11": "a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn\u2019t hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around", "12": " the shoulder of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and further off, and byandby, after an hour, I didn\u2019", "13": "t hear it no more. The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn\u2019t yet ", "14": "a while. They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming onc", "15": "e in a while as they went. I crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the island they quit ", "16": "shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town. I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come ", "17": "ahunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my", "18": " blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn\u2019t get at them. I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw, and tow", "19": "ards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast. When it was dark I s", "20": "et by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well satisfied; but byandby it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on the", "21": " bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went t", "22": "o bed; there ain\u2019t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can\u2019t stay so, you soon get over it. And so for three", "23": " days and nights. No difference\u2014just the same thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was bos", "24": "s of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found pl", "25": "enty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning ", "26": "to show. They would all come handy byandby, I judged. Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn\u2019t far fr", "27": "om the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn\u2019t shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game ", "28": "nigh home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a goodsized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, an", "29": "d I after it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire th", "30": "at was still smoking. My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went snea", "31": "king back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, bu", "32": "t my breath come so hard I couldn\u2019t hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and ", "33": "so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my", "34": " breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too. When I got to camp I warn\u2019t feeling very brash, there warn\u2019t much ", "35": "sand in my craw; but I says, this ain\u2019t no time to be fooling around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have th", "36": "em out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year\u2019s camp, and then clumb a tr", "37": "ee. I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn\u2019t see nothing, I didn\u2019t hear nothing\u2014I only _thought_ I heard and seen a", "38": "s much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn\u2019t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on", "39": " the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast. By the time it was night I ", "40": "was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank\u2014abou", "41": "t a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night", "42": " when I hear a _plunketyplunk, plunketyplunk_, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people\u2019s voices. I got everyth", "43": "ing into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn\u2019t got far ", "44": "when I hear a man say: \u201cWe better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out. Let\u2019s look around.\u201d I did", "45": "n\u2019t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe. I didn\u2019t sl", "46": "eep much. I couldn\u2019t, somehow, for thinking. And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn\u2019", "47": "t do me no good. Byandby I says to myself, I can\u2019t live this way; I\u2019m agoing to find out who it is that\u2019s here on the island wit", "48": "h me; I\u2019ll find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off. So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, a", "49": "nd then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as l", "50": "ight as day. I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to", "51": " the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I ", "52": "give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. I", "53": " sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the ", "54": "river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped ", "55": "off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn\u2019t no luck somehow; I could", "56": "n\u2019t seem to find the place. But byandby, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautiou", "57": "s and slow. Byandby I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fantods. He had a", "58": " blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, a", "59": "nd kept my eyes on him steady.

And, besides,", "30": " he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet? So we went back and got the cano", "31": "e, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in", "32": ", amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner. The door ", "33": "of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat a", "34": "nd a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner. We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat ", "35": "our dinner in there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thund", "36": "er and lighten; so the birds was right about it.

Well, on every old brokendown tree you could see rabb", "53": "its and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungr", "54": "y, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles\u2014they would slide of", "55": "f in the water.

We got an old tin lantern, and a butcherknife without any hand", "11": "le, and a brannew Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and", "12": " a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and al", "13": "l such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, a", "14": "nd a roll of buckskin, and a leather dogcollar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn\u2019t have no label on them; a", "15": "nd just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good currycomb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow, and a wooden leg. The stra", "16": "ps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, ", "17": "and we couldn\u2019t find the other one, though we hunted all around. And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was re", "18": "ady to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe a", "19": "nd cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off. I paddled over to the Illino", "20": "is shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn\u2019t no accidents and di", "21": "dn\u2019t see nobody. We got home all safe. CHAPTER X. After breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come ", "22": "to be killed, but Jim didn\u2019t want to. He said it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha\u2019nt us; he said", "23": " a man that warn\u2019t buried was more likely to go aha\u2019nting around than one that was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty ", "24": "reasonable, so I didn\u2019t say no more; but I couldn\u2019t keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what t", "25": "hey done it for. We rummaged the clothes we\u2019d got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket ov", "26": "ercoat. Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they\u2019d a knowed the money was there they wouldn", "27": "\u2019t a left it. I said I reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn\u2019t want to talk about that. I says: \u201cNow you think it\u2019s bad lu", "28": "ck; but what did you say when I fetched in the snakeskin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday? You said it ", "29": "was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hands. Well, here\u2019s your bad luck! We\u2019ve raked in all this truc", "30": "k and eight dollars besides.

Mind I tell you, it\u2019s acomin\u2019.\u201d It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that ta", "32": "lk. Well, after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to", "33": " the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on the foot of Jim\u2019s blanket, ever so", "34": " natural, thinking there\u2019d be some fun when Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the snake, and when Jim flung", "35": " himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake\u2019s mate was there, and bit him. He jumped up yelling, and the first", "36": " thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a second with a stick, and Jim", "37": " grabbed pap\u2019s whiskyjug and begun to pour it down. He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes o", "38": "f my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. ", "39": "Jim told me to chop off the snake\u2019s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he ea", "40": "t it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that woul", "41": "d help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn\u2019t going to let Jim find out it wa", "42": "s all my fault, not if I could help it. Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched ar", "43": "ound and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so d", "44": "id his leg; but byandby the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I\u2019d druther been bit with a snake than pa", "45": "p\u2019s whisky. Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind ", "46": "I wouldn\u2019t ever take aholt of a snakeskin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would ", "47": "believe him next time. And he said that handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn\u2019t got to the end of it y", "48": "et. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskin in his hand.", "49": " Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I\u2019ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder i", "50": "s one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less th", "51": "an two years he got drunk and fell off of the shottower, and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you ma", "52": "y say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn\u2019t see it. Pap ", "53": "told me. But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool. Well, the days went along, and the river went down", "54": " between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it an", "55": "d catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn\u2019t han", "56": "dle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. W", "57": "e found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there ", "58": "was a spool in it. Jim said he\u2019d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was", "59": " ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn\u2019t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at", "60": " the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there; everybody buys some of him; his meat\u2019s ", "61": "as white as snow and makes a good fry. Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring up some ", "62": "way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go ", "63": "in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said, couldn\u2019t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl", "64": "? That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got in"}, "184": {"1": "to it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the sunbonnet and tied it under my chin, and then f", "2": "or a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the dayt", "3": "ime, hardly. I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and byandby I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said", "4": " I didn\u2019t walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britchespocket. I took notice, and done bett", "5": "er. I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark. I started across to the town from a little below the ferryland", "6": "ing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I tied up and started along the bank. There was a lig", "7": "ht burning in a little shanty that hadn\u2019t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there. I slippe", "8": "d up and peeped in at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table.", "9": " I didn\u2019t know her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn\u2019t start a face in that town that I didn\u2019t know. Now this was lucky, ", "10": "because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this woman had been", "11": " in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t", "12": " forget I was a girl. CHAPTER XI. \u201cCome in,\u201d says the woman, and I did. She says: \u201cTake a cheer.\u201d I done it. She looked me all o", "13": "ver with her little shiny eyes, and says: \u201cWhat might your name be?\u201d \u201cSarah Williams.\u201d \u201cWhere \u2019bouts do you live?

Col.

His f", "41": "orehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders.

He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn\u2019t", "44": " no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn\u2019t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be\u2014you could feel that, you know, an", "45": "d so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a libertypole, an", "46": "d the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was", "47": " afterwards. He didn\u2019t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners\u2014everybody was always goodmannered where he was. Everybody", "48": " loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always\u2014I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a clou", "49": "dbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn\u2019t nothing go wrong again for a week. When him and t", "50": "he old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them goodday, and didn\u2019t set down again ", "51": "till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed i", "52": "t to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom\u2019s and Bob\u2019s was mixed, and then they bowed and said, \u201cOur duty to you, ", "53": "sir, and madam;\u201d and _they_ bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom p", "54": "oured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me", "55": " and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.

Each person had their own nigger to wait on them\u2014Buck too. My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn\u2019t used to", "61": " having anybody do anything for me, but Buck\u2019s was on the jump most of the time. This was all there was of the family now, but t", "62": "here used to be more\u2014three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.

There was another clan of aristocracy around there\u2014five or six families\u2014mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as", "3": " hightoned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamb", "4": "oat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a", "5": " lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses. One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse co", "6": "ming. We was crossing the road. Buck says: \u201cQuick!

Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had ", "8": "his gun across his pommel. I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck\u2019s gun go off at my ear, and Harn", "9": "ey\u2019s hat tumbled off from his head.

I tucked the moneybag in under the lid, just down beyond where his han", "2": "ds was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door. The person co", "3": "ming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I s", "4": "ee she begun to cry, though I couldn\u2019t hear her, and her back was to me. I slid out, and as I passed the diningroom I thought I\u2019", "5": "d make sure them watchers hadn\u2019t seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything was all right.

I don\u2019", "13": "t wish to be mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself. When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut u", "14": "p, and the watchers was gone. There warn\u2019t nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their fac", "15": "es to see if anything had been happening, but I couldn\u2019t tell. Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, a", "16": "nd they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more f", "17": "rom the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full.

Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in", "19": " the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down a", "20": "t the dead man\u2019s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats h", "21": "olding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn\u2019t no other sound but the scrap", "22": "ing of the feet on the floor and blowing noses\u2014because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places e", "23": "xcept church. When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, p", "24": "utting on the last touches, and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He", "25": " never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with ", "26": "his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there w", "27": "arn\u2019t no more smile to him than there is to a ham. They had borrowed a melodeum\u2014a sick one; and when everything was ready a youn", "28": "g woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only ", "29": "one that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and s", "30": "traight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful", "31": " racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait\u2014you couldn\u2019t hear yourself t", "32": "hink. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn\u2019t seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that longlegged undertaker ", "33": "make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry\u2014just depend on me.\u201d Then he stooped down and begun to glide alon", "34": "g the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people\u2019s heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and m", "35": "ore outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in abou", "36": "t two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, ", "37": "and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker\u2019s back and shoulders glidi", "38": "ng along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with", "39": " his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people\u2019s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \u201c", "40": "_He had a rat!_\u201d Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to", "41": " the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don\u2019t cost nothing, and it\u2019s just the little things", "42": " that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn\u2019t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was. Well, th", "43": "e funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbag", "44": "e, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screwdriver. I was in a sweat th", "45": "en, and watched him pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight", "46": " and fast. So there I was! I didn\u2019t know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I, s\u2019pose somebody has hogged that bag ", "47": "on the sly?\u2014now how do _I_ know whether to write to Mary Jane or not?

Blame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I\u2019d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the", "49": " thing\u2019s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I\u2019ve worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I\u2019d just let it alone, d", "50": "ad fetch the whole business!

And he said of co", "55": "urse him and William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well f", "56": "ixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too\u2014tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in", "57": " the world; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.

Yes, Austria ", "15": "was far from the world, and asleep, and our village was in the middle of that sleep, being in the middle of Austria. It drowsed ", "16": "in peace in the deep privacy of a hilly and woodsy solitude where news from the world hardly ever came to disturb its dreams, an", "17": "d was infinitely content.

The whole region for leagues around was the hereditary property of a prince, whose servants kept the cast", "23": "le always in perfect condition for occupancy, but neither he nor his family came there oftener than once in five years. When the", "24": "y came it was as if the lord of the world had arrived, and had brought all the glories of its kingdoms along; and when they went", "25": " they left a calm behind which was like the deep sleep which follows an orgy. Eseldorf was a paradise for us boys. We were not o", "26": "vermuch pestered with schooling. Mainly we were trained to be good Christians; to revere the Virgin, the Church, and the saints ", "27": "above everything. Beyond these matters we were not required to know much; and, in fact, not allowed to. Knowledge was not good f", "28": "or the common people, and could make them discontented with the lot which God had appointed for them, and God would not endure d", "29": "iscontentment with His plans. We had two priests. One of them, Father Adolf, was a very zealous and strenuous priest, much consi", "30": "dered. There may have been better priests, in some ways, than Father Adolf, but there was never one in our commune who was held ", "31": "in more solemn and awful respect. This was because he had absolutely no fear of the Devil. He was the only Christian I have ever", "32": " known of whom that could be truly said. People stood in deep dread of him on that account; for they thought that there must be ", "33": "something supernatural about him, else he could not be so bold and so confident. All men speak in bitter disapproval of the Devi", "34": "l, but they do it reverently, not flippantly; but Father Adolf's way was very different; he called him by every name he could la", "35": "y his tongue to, and it made everyone shudder that heard him; and often he would even speak of him scornfully and scoffingly; th", "36": "en the people crossed themselves and went quickly out of his presence, fearing that something fearful might happen. Father Adolf", "37": " had actually met Satan face to face more than once, and defied him. This was known to be so. Father Adolf said it himself. He n", "38": "ever made any secret of it, but spoke it right out. And that he was speaking true there was proof in at least one instance, for ", "39": "on that occasion he quarreled with the enemy, and intrepidly threw his bottle at him; and there, upon the wall of his study, was", "40": " the ruddy splotch where it struck and broke. But it was Father Peter, the other priest, that we all loved best and were sorries", "41": "t for. Some people charged him with talking around in conversation that God was all goodness and would find a way to save all hi", "42": "s poor human children. It was a horrible thing to say, but there was never any absolute proof that Father Peter said it; and it ", "43": "was out of character for him to say it, too, for he was always good and gentle and truthful. He wasn't charged with saying it in", "44": " the pulpit, where all the congregation could hear and testify, but only outside, in talk; and it is easy for enemies to manufac", "45": "ture that. Father Peter had an enemy and a very powerful one, the astrologer who lived in a tumbled old tower up the valley, and", "46": " put in his nights studying the stars. Every one knew he could foretell wars and famines, though that was not so hard, for there", "47": " was always a war, and generally a famine somewhere. But he could also read any man's life through the stars in a big book he ha", "48": "d, and find lost property, and every one in the village except Father Peter stood in awe of him. Even Father Adolf, who had defi", "49": "ed the Devil, had a wholesome respect for the astrologer when he came through our village wearing his tall, pointed hat and his ", "50": "long, flowing robe with stars on it, carrying his big book, and a staff which was known to have magic power. The bishop himself ", "51": "sometimes listened to the astrologer, it was said, for, besides studying the stars and prophesying, the astrologer made a great ", "52": "show of piety, which would impress the bishop, of course. But Father Peter took no stock in the astrologer. He denounced him ope", "53": "nly as a charlatana fraud with no valuable knowledge of any kind, or powers beyond those of an ordinary and rather inferior huma", "54": "n being, which naturally made the astrologer hate Father Peter and wish to ruin him. It was the astrologer, as we all believed, ", "55": "who originated the story about Father Peter's shocking remark and carried it to the bishop. It was said that Father Peter had ma", "56": "de the remark to his niece, Marget, though Marget denied it and implored the bishop to believe her and spare her old uncle from ", "57": "poverty and disgrace. But the bishop wouldn't listen. He suspended Father Peter indefinitely, though he wouldn't go so far as to", "58": " excommunicate him on the evidence of only one witness; and now Father Peter had been out a couple of years, and our other pries", "59": "t, Father Adolf, had his flock. Those had been hard years for the old priest and Marget. They had been favorites, but of course ", "60": "that changed when they came under the shadow of the bishop's frown. Many of their friends fell away entirely, and the rest becam", "61": "e cool and distant. Marget was a lovely girl of eighteen when the trouble came, and she had the best head in the village, and th", "62": "e most in it. She taught the harp, and earned all her clothes and pocket money by her own industry. But her scholars fell off on", "63": "e by one now; she was forgotten when there were dances and parties among the youth of the village; the young fellows stopped com", "64": "ing to the house, all except Wilhelm Meidlingand he could have been spared; she and her uncle were sad and forlorn in their negl"}, "243": {"1": "ect and disgrace, and the sunshine was gone out of their lives.

He had se", "18": "en many ghosts in his time, and witches and enchanters, and once he was lost in a fierce storm at midnight in the mountains, and", "19": " by the glare of the lightning had seen the Wild Huntsman rage on the blast with his specter dogs chasing after him through the ", "20": "driving cloudrack. Also he had seen an incubus once, and several times he had seen the great bat that sucks the blood from the n", "21": "ecks of people while they are asleep, fanning them softly with its wings and so keeping them drowsy till they die. He encouraged", "22": " us not to fear supernatural things, such as ghosts, and said they did no harm, but only wandered about because they were lonely", "23": " and distressed and wanted kindly notice and compassion; and in time we learned not to be afraid, and even went down with him in", "24": " the night to the haunted chamber in the dungeons of the castle. The ghost appeared only once, and it went by very dim to the si", "25": "ght and floated noiseless through the air, and then disappeared; and we scarcely trembled, he had taught us so well. He said it ", "26": "came up sometimes in the night and woke him by passing its clammy hand over his face, but it did him no hurt; it only wanted sym", "27": "pathy and notice. But the strangest thing was that he had seen angelsactual angels out of heavenand had talked with them. They h", "28": "ad no wings, and wore clothes, and talked and looked and acted just like any natural person, and you would never know them for a", "29": "ngels except for the wonderful things they did which a mortal could not do, and the way they suddenly disappeared while you were", "30": " talking with them, which was also a thing which no mortal could do. And he said they were pleasant and cheerful, not gloomy and", "31": " melancholy, like ghosts. It was after that kind of a talk one May night that we got up next morning and had a good breakfast wi", "32": "th him and then went down and crossed the bridge and went away up into the hills on the left to a woody hilltop which was a favo", "33": "rite place of ours, and there we stretched out on the grass in the shade to rest and smoke and talk over these strange things, f", "34": "or they were in our minds yet, and impressing us. But we couldn't smoke, because we had been heedless and left our flint and ste", "35": "el behind. Soon there came a youth strolling toward us through the trees, and he sat down and began to talk in a friendly way, j", "36": "ust as if he knew us. But we did not answer him, for he was a stranger and we were not used to strangers and were shy of them. H", "37": "e had new and good clothes on, and was handsome and had a winning face and a pleasant voice, and was easy and graceful and unemb", "38": "arrassed, not slouchy and awkward and diffident, like other boys. We wanted to be friendly with him, but didn't know how to begi", "39": "n. Then I thought of the pipe, and wondered if it would be taken as kindly meant if I offered it to him. But I remembered that w", "40": "e had no fire, so I was sorry and disappointed. But he looked up bright and pleased, and said: \u201cFire? Oh, that is easy; I will f", "41": "urnish it.\u201d I was so astonished I couldn't speak; for I had not said anything. He took the pipe and blew his breath on it, and t", "42": "he tobacco glowed red, and spirals of blue smoke rose up. We jumped up and were going to run, for that was natural; and we did r", "43": "un a few steps, although he was yearningly pleading for us to stay, and giving us his word that he would not do us any harm, but", "44": " only wanted to be friends with us and have company. So we stopped and stood, and wanted to go back, being full of curiosity and", "45": " wonder, but afraid to venture.

And then the main part of her mind was on Traum, anyway; she couldn't keep her eyes off ", "25": "him, he was so beautiful. That gratified me, and made me proud.

I was as", "4": "hamed, for it showed us to be what Satan considered us, a silly race and trivial.

There was an uncomfortable silence, but relief soon came, ", "2": "for that poor dog came along now, with his eye hanging down, and went straight to Satan, and began to moan and mutter brokenly, ", "3": "and Satan began to answer in the same way, and it was plain that they were talking together in the dog language.

We got the men and Father Adolf, and we saw the man die. Nobody cared but the dog; he mourned and grieved, and licked the dead", "16": " face, and could not be comforted. We buried him where he was, and without a coffin, for he had no money, and no friend but the ", "17": "dog. If we had been an hour earlier the priest would have been in time to send that poor creature to heaven, but now he was gone", "18": " down into the awful fires, to burn forever. It seemed such a pity that in a world where so many people have difficulty to put i", "19": "n their time, one little hour could not have been spared for this poor creature who needed it so much, and to whom it would have", "20": " made the difference between eternal joy and eternal pain. It gave an appalling idea of the value of an hour, and I thought I co", "21": "uld never waste one again without remorse and terror. Seppi was depressed and grieved, and said it must be so much better to be ", "22": "a dog and not run such awful risks. We took this one home with us and kept him for our own. Seppi had a very good thought as we ", "23": "were walking along, and it cheered us up and made us feel much better. He said the dog had forgiven the man that had wronged him", "24": " so, and maybe God would accept that absolution. There was a very dull week, now, for Satan did not come, nothing much was going", "25": " on, and we boys could not venture to go and see Marget, because the nights were moonlit and our parents might find us out if we", "26": " tried. But we came across Ursula a couple of times taking a walk in the meadows beyond the river to air the cat, and we learned", "27": " from her that things were going well. She had natty new clothes on and bore a prosperous look. The four groschen a day were arr", "28": "iving without a break, but were not being spent for food and wine and such thingsthe cat attended to all that. Marget was enduri", "29": "ng her forsakenness and isolation fairly well, all things considered, and was cheerful, by help of Wilhelm Meidling. She spent a", "30": "n hour or two every night in the jail with her uncle, and had fattened him up with the cat's contributions. But she was curious ", "31": "to know more about Philip Traum, and hoped I would bring him again. Ursula was curious about him herself, and asked a good many ", "32": "questions about his uncle. It made the boys laugh, for I had told them the nonsense Satan had been stuffing her with. She got no", "33": " satisfaction out of us, our tongues being tied. Ursula gave us a small item of information: money being plenty now, she had tak", "34": "en on a servant to help about the house and run errands. She tried to tell it in a commonplace, matterofcourse way, but she was ", "35": "so set up by it and so vain of it that her pride in it leaked out pretty plainly. It was beautiful to see her veiled delight in ", "36": "this grandeur, poor old thing, but when we heard the name of the servant we wondered if she had been altogether wise; for althou", "37": "gh we were young, and often thoughtless, we had fairly good perception on some matters. This boy was Gottfried Narr, a dull, goo", "38": "d creature, with no harm in him and nothing against him personally; still, he was under a cloud, and properly so, for it had not", "39": " been six months since a social blight had mildewed the familyhis grandmother had been burned as a witch. When that kind of a ma", "40": "lady is in the blood it does not always come out with just one burning. Just now was not a good time for Ursula and Marget to be", "41": " having dealings with a member of such a family, for the witchterror had risen higher during the past year than it had ever reac", "42": "hed in the memory of the oldest villagers. The mere mention of a witch was almost enough to frighten us out of our wits. This wa", "43": "s natural enough, because of late years there were more kinds of witches than there used to be; in old times it had been only ol", "44": "d women, but of late years they were of all ageseven children of eight and nine; it was getting so that anybody might turn out t", "45": "o be a familiar of the Devilage and sex hadn't anything to do with it. In our little region we had tried to extirpate the witche", "46": "s, but the more of them we burned the more of the breed rose up in their places. Once, in a school for girls only ten miles away", "47": ", the teachers found that the back of one of the girls was all red and inflamed, and they were greatly frightened, believing it ", "48": "to be the Devil's marks. The girl was scared, and begged them not to denounce her, and said it was only fleas; but of course it ", "49": "would not do to let the matter rest there. All the girls were examined, and eleven out of the fifty were badly marked, the rest ", "50": "less so. A commission was appointed, but the eleven only cried for their mothers and would not confess. Then they were shut up, ", "51": "each by herself, in the dark, and put on black bread and water for ten days and nights; and by that time they were haggard and w", "52": "ild, and their eyes were dry and they did not cry any more, but only sat and mumbled, and would not take the food. Then one of t", "53": "hem confessed, and said they had often ridden through the air on broomsticks to the witches' Sabbath, and in a bleak place high ", "54": "up in the mountains had danced and drunk and caroused with several hundred other witches and the Evil One, and all had conducted", "55": " themselves in a scandalous way and had reviled the priests and blasphemed God. That is what she saidnot in narrative form, for ", "56": "she was not able to remember any of the details without having them called to her mind one after the other; but the commission d", "57": "id that, for they knew just what questions to ask, they being all written down for the use of witchcommissioners two centuries b", "58": "efore. They asked, \u201cDid you do so and so?\u201d and she always said yes, and looked weary and tired, and took no interest in it. And ", "59": "so when the other ten heard that this one confessed, they confessed, too, and answered yes to the questions. Then they were burn", "60": "ed at the stake all together, which was just and right; and everybody went from all the countryside to see it. I went, too; but ", "61": "when I saw that one of them was a bonny, sweet girl I used to play with, and looked so pitiful there chained to the stake, and h", "62": "er mother crying over her and devouring her with kisses and clinging around her neck, and saying, \u201cOh, my God! Oh, my God!\u201d it w", "63": "as too dreadful, and I went away. It was bitter cold weather when Gottfried's grandmother was burned. It was charged that she ha", "64": "d cured bad headaches by kneading the person's head and neck with her fingersas she saidbut really by the Devil's help, as every"}, "252": {"1": "body knew. They were going to examine her, but she stopped them, and confessed straight off that her power was from the Devil. S", "2": "o they appointed to burn her next morning, early, in our marketsquare. The officer who was to prepare the fire was there first, ", "3": "and prepared it. She was there nextbrought by the constables, who left her and went to fetch another witch. Her family did not c", "4": "ome with her. They might be reviled, maybe stoned, if the people were excited. I came, and gave her an apple. She was squatting ", "5": "at the fire, warming herself and waiting; and her old lips and hands were blue with the cold. A stranger came next. He was a tra", "6": "veler, passing through; and he spoke to her gently, and, seeing nobody but me there to hear, said he was sorry for her. And he a", "7": "sked if what she confessed was true, and she said no. He looked surprised and still more sorry then, and asked her: \u201cThen why di", "8": "d you confess?\u201d \u201cI am old and very poor,\u201d she said, \u201cand I work for my living. There was no way but to confess. If I hadn't they", "9": " might have set me free. That would ruin me, for no one would forget that I had been suspected of being a witch, and so I would ", "10": "get no more work, and wherever I went they would set the dogs on me. In a little while I would starve. The fire is best; it is s", "11": "oon over. You have been good to me, you two, and I thank you.\u201d She snuggled closer to the fire, and put out her hands to warm th", "12": "em, the snowflakes descending soft and still on her old gray head and making it white and whiter. The crowd was gathering now, a", "13": "nd an egg came flying and struck her in the eye, and broke and ran down her face. There was a laugh at that. I told Satan all ab", "14": "out the eleven girls and the old woman, once, but it did not affect him. He only said it was the human race, and what the human ", "15": "race did was of no consequence. And he said he had seen it made; and it was not made of clay; it was made of mudpart of it was, ", "16": "anyway. I knew what he meant by thatthe Moral Sense. He saw the thought in my head, and it tickled him and made him laugh. Then ", "17": "he called a bullock out of a pasture and petted it and talked with it, and said: \u201cTherehe wouldn't drive children mad with hunge", "18": "r and fright and loneliness, and then burn them for confessing to things invented for them which had never happened. And neither", "19": " would he break the hearts of innocent, poor old women and make them afraid to trust themselves among their own race; and he wou", "20": "ld not insult them in their deathagony. For he is not besmirched with the Moral Sense, but is as the angels are, and knows no wr", "21": "ong, and never does it.\u201d Lovely as he was, Satan could be cruelly offensive when he chose; and he always chose when the human ra", "22": "ce was brought to his attention. He always turned up his nose at it, and never had a kind word for it. Well, as I was saying, we", "23": " boys doubted if it was a good time for Ursula to be hiring a member of the Narr family. We were right. When the people found it", "24": " out they were naturally indignant. And, moreover, since Marget and Ursula hadn't enough to eat themselves, where was the money ", "25": "coming from to feed another mouth? That is what they wanted to know; and in order to find out they stopped avoiding Gottfried an", "26": "d began to seek his society and have sociable conversations with him. He was pleasednot thinking any harm and not seeing the tra", "27": "pand so he talked innocently along, and was no discreeter than a cow. \u201cMoney!\u201d he said; \u201cthey've got plenty of it. They pay me t", "28": "wo groschen a week, besides my keep. And they live on the fat of the land, I can tell you; the prince himself can't beat their t", "29": "able.\u201d This astonishing statement was conveyed by the astrologer to Father Adolf on a Sunday morning when he was returning from ", "30": "mass. He was deeply moved, and said: \u201cThis must be looked into.\u201d He said there must be witchcraft at the bottom of it, and told ", "31": "the villagers to resume relations with Marget and Ursula in a private and unostentatious way, and keep both eyes open. They were", "32": " told to keep their own counsel, and not rouse the suspicions of the household. The villagers were at first a bit reluctant to e", "33": "nter such a dreadful place, but the priest said they would be under his protection while there, and no harm could come to them, ", "34": "particularly if they carried a trifle of holy water along and kept their beads and crosses handy. This satisfied them and made t", "35": "hem willing to go; envy and malice made the baser sort even eager to go. And so poor Marget began to have company again, and was", "36": " as pleased as a cat. She was like 'most anybody elsejust human, and happy in her prosperities and not averse from showing them ", "37": "off a little; and she was humanly grateful to have the warm shoulder turned to her and be smiled upon by her friends and the vil", "38": "lage again; for of all the hard things to bear, to be cut by your neighbors and left in contemptuous solitude is maybe the harde", "39": "st. The bars were down, and we could all go there now, and we didour parents and allday after day. The cat began to strain herse", "40": "lf. She provided the top of everything for those companies, and in abundanceamong them many a dish and many a wine which they ha", "41": "d not tasted before and which they had not even heard of except at secondhand from the prince's servants. And the tableware was ", "42": "much above ordinary, too. Marget was troubled at times, and pursued Ursula with questions to an uncomfortable degree; but Ursula", "43": " stood her ground and stuck to it that it was Providence, and said no word about the cat. Marget knew that nothing was impossibl", "44": "e to Providence, but she could not help having doubts that this effort was from there, though she was afraid to say so, lest dis", "45": "aster come of it. Witchcraft occurred to her, but she put the thought aside, for this was before Gottfried joined the household,", "46": " and she knew Ursula was pious and a bitter hater of witches. By the time Gottfried arrived Providence was established, unshakab", "47": "ly intrenched, and getting all the gratitude. The cat made no murmur, but went on composedly improving in style and prodigality ", "48": "by experience. In any community, big or little, there is always a fair proportion of people who are not malicious or unkind by n", "49": "ature, and who never do unkind things except when they are overmastered by fear, or when their selfinterest is greatly in danger", "50": ", or some such matter as that. Eseldorf had its proportion of such people, and ordinarily their good and gentle influence was fe", "51": "lt, but these were not ordinary timeson account of the witchdreadand so we did not seem to have any gentle and compassionate hea", "52": "rts left, to speak of. Every person was frightened at the unaccountable state of things at Marget's house, not doubting that wit", "53": "chcraft was at the bottom of it, and fright frenzied their reason. Naturally there were some who pitied Marget and Ursula for th", "54": "e danger that was gathering about them, but naturally they did not say so; it would not have been safe. So the others had it all", "55": " their own way, and there was none to advise the ignorant girl and the foolish woman and warn them to modify their doings. We bo", "56": "ys wanted to warn them, but we backed down when it came to the pinch, being afraid. We found that we were not manly enough nor b", "57": "rave enough to do a generous action when there was a chance that it could get us into trouble. Neither of us confessed this poor", "58": " spirit to the others, but did as other people would have donedropped the subject and talked about something else. And I knew we", "59": " all felt mean, eating and drinking Marget's fine things along with those companies of spies, and petting her and complimenting ", "60": "her with the rest, and seeing with selfreproach how foolishly happy she was, and never saying a word to put her on her guard. An", "61": "d, indeed, she was happy, and as proud as a princess, and so grateful to have friends again. And all the time these people were ", "62": "watching with all their eyes and reporting all they saw to Father Adolf. But he couldn't make head or tail of the situation. The", "63": "re must be an enchanter somewhere on the premises, but who was it? Marget was not seen to do any jugglery, nor was Ursula, nor y", "64": "et Gottfried; and still the wines and dainties never ran short, and a guest could not call for a thing and not get it. To produc"}, "253": {"1": "e these effects was usual enough with witches and enchantersthat part of it was not new; but to do it without any incantations, ", "2": "or even any rumblings or earthquakes or lightnings or apparitionsthat was new, novel, wholly irregular. There was nothing in the", "3": " books like this. Enchanted things were always unreal. Gold turned to dirt in an unenchanted atmosphere, food withered away and ", "4": "vanished. But this test failed in the present case. The spies brought samples: Father Adolf prayed over them, exorcised them, bu", "5": "t it did no good; they remained sound and real, they yielded to natural decay only, and took the usual time to do it. Father Ado", "6": "lf was not merely puzzled, he was also exasperated; for these evidences very nearly convinced himprivatelythat there was no witc", "7": "hcraft in the matter. It did not wholly convince him, for this could be a new kind of witchcraft. There was a way to find out as", "8": " to this: if this prodigal abundance of provender was not brought in from the outside, but produced on the premises, there was w", "9": "itchcraft, sure. Chapter 7 Marget announced a party, and invited forty people; the date for it was seven days away. This was a f", "10": "ine opportunity. Marget's house stood by itself, and it could be easily watched. All the week it was watched night and day. Marg", "11": "et's household went out and in as usual, but they carried nothing in their hands, and neither they nor others brought anything t", "12": "o the house. This was ascertained.

Then the vision vanished, and was followed by a long series of unknown wars, ", "36": "murders, and massacres. Next we had the Flood, and the Ark tossing around in the stormy waters, with lofty mountains in the dist", "37": "ance showing veiled and dim through the rain. Satan said: \u201cThe progress of your race was not satisfactory. It is to have another", "38": " chance now.\u201d The scene changed, and we saw Noah overcome with wine.

And Wilhelm could not explain why he ", "50": "only thought of the date on the coins at the last moment, instead of earlier; he said it just occurred to him, all of a sudden, ", "51": "like an inspiration, and he brought it right out without any hesitation, for, although he didn't examine the coins, he seemed, s", "52": "omehow, to know it was true.

I judged that he had spirited himself away to the jail to tell the prisoner the news; and in this I was right.

I apologized, as well as I co", "26": "uld; but privately I did not think much of his processesat that time. Satan was accustomed to say that our race lived a life of ", "27": "continuous and uninterrupted selfdeception.

Satan put the seed in the ground, put a handful of dust on it, and sa", "50": "id, \u201cRise!\u201d A tiny stem shot up and began to grow, and grew so fast that in five minutes it was a great tree, and we were sittin", "51": "g in the shade of it. There was a murmur of wonder, then all looked up and saw a strange and pretty sight, for the branches were", "52": " heavy with fruits of many kinds and colorsoranges, grapes, bananas, peaches, cherries, apricots, and so on. Baskets were brough", "53": "t, and the unlading of the tree began; and the people crowded around Satan and kissed his hand, and praised him, calling him the", "54": " prince of jugglers.

They were much excited about this new piece of gossip, and they asked questi", "4": "ons, so as to get at a full understanding of it. They asked what a picture was, and the cat explained. \u201cIt is a flat thing,\u201d he ", "5": "said; \u201cwonderfully flat, marvelously flat, enchantingly flat and elegant.

And now for the first time Mr. McWilliams showed feeling. Whenever I perceive this sign on this man's dial, I comprehend", "23": " it, and lapse into silence, and give him opportunity to unload his heart. Said he, with but illcontrolled emotion: \u201cI do not go", "24": " one single cent on burglar alarms, Mr. Twainnot a single centand I will tell you why. When we were finishing our house, we foun", "25": "d we had a little cash left over, on account of the plumber not knowing it. I was for enlightening the heathen with it, for I wa", "26": "s always unaccountably down on the heathen somehow; but Mrs. McWilliams said no, let's have a burglar alarm. I agreed to this co", "27": "mpromise. I will explain that whenever I want a thing, and Mrs. McWilliams wants another thing, and we decide upon the thing tha", "28": "t Mrs. McWilliams wantsas we always doshe calls that a compromise. Very well: the man came up from New York and put in the alarm", "29": ", and charged three hundred and twentyfive dollars for it, and said we could sleep without uneasiness now. So we did for awhiles", "30": "ay a month. Then one night we smelled smoke, and I was advised to get up and see what the matter was. I lit a candle, and starte", "31": "d toward the stairs, and met a burglar coming out of a room with a basket of tinware, which he had mistaken for solid silver in ", "32": "the dark. He was smoking a pipe. I said, 'My friend, we do not allow smoking in this room.' He said he was a stranger, and could", "33": " not be expected to know the rules of the house: said he had been in many houses just as good as this one, and it had never been", "34": " objected to before. He added that as far as his experience went, such rules had never been considered to apply to burglars, any", "35": "way. \u201cI said: 'Smoke along, then, if it is the custom, though I think that the conceding of a privilege to a burglar which is de", "36": "nied to a bishop is a conspicuous sign of the looseness of the times. But waiving all that, what business have you to be enterin", "37": "g this house in this furtive and clandestine way, without ringing the burglar alarm?' \u201cHe looked confused and ashamed, and said,", "38": " with embarrassment: 'I beg a thousand pardons. I did not know you had a burglar alarm, else I would have rung it. I beg you wil", "39": "l not mention it where my parents may hear of it, for they are old and feeble, and such a seemingly wanton breach of the hallowe", "40": "d conventionalities of our Christian civilization might all too rudely sunder the frail bridge which hangs darkling between the ", "41": "pale and evanescent present and the solemn great deeps of the eternities. May I trouble you for a match?' \u201cI said: 'Your sentime", "42": "nts do you honor, but if you will allow me to say it, metaphor is not your best hold. Spare your thigh; this kind light only on ", "43": "the box, and seldom there, in fact, if my experience may be trusted. But to return to business: how did you get in here?' \u201c'Thro", "44": "ugh a secondstory window.' \u201cIt was even so. I redeemed the tinware at pawnbroker's rates, less cost of advertising, bade the bur", "45": "glar goodnight, closed the window after him, and retired to headquarters to report. Next morning we sent for the burglaralarm ma", "46": "n, and he came up and explained that the reason the alarm did not 'go off' was that no part of the house but the first floor was", "47": " attached to the alarm. This was simply idiotic; one might as well have no armor on at all in battle as to have it only on his l", "48": "egs. The expert now put the whole second story on the alarm, charged three hundred dollars for it, and went his way. By and by, ", "49": "one night, I found a burglar in the third story, about to start down a ladder with a lot of miscellaneous property. My first imp", "50": "ulse was to crack his head with a billiard cue; but my second was to refrain from this attention, because he was between me and ", "51": "the cue rack. The second impulse was plainly the soundest, so I refrained, and proceeded to compromise. I redeemed the property ", "52": "at former rates, after deducting ten per cent. for use of ladder, it being my ladder, and, next day we sent down for the expert ", "53": "once more, and had the third story attached to the alarm, for three hundred dollars. \u201cBy this time the 'annunciator' had grown t", "54": "o formidable dimensions. It had fortyseven tags on it, marked with the names of the various rooms and chimneys, and it occupied ", "55": "the space of an ordinary wardrobe. The gong was the size of a washbowl, and was placed above the head of our bed. There was a wi", "56": "re from the house to the coachman's quarters in the stable, and a noble gong alongside his pillow. \u201cWe should have been comforta", "57": "ble now but for one defect. Every morning at five the cook opened the kitchen door, in the way of business, and rip went that go", "58": "ng! The first time this happened I thought the last day was come sure. I didn't think it in bedno, but out of itfor the first ef", "59": "fect of that frightful gong is to hurl you across the house, and slam you against the wall, and then curl you up, and squirm you", "60": " like a spider on a stove lid, till somebody shuts the kitchen door. In solid fact, there is no clamor that is even remotely com", "61": "parable to the dire clamor which that gong makes. Well, this catastrophe happened every morning regularly at five o'clock, and l", "62": "ost us three hours sleep; for, mind you, when that thing wakes you, it doesn't merely wake you in spots; it wakes you all over, ", "63": "conscience and all, and you are good for eighteen hours of wideawakeness subsequentlyeighteen hours of the very most inconceivab", "64": "le wideawakeness that you ever experienced in your life. A stranger died on our hands one time, and we vacated and left him in o"}, "268": {"1": "ur room overnight. Did that stranger wait for the general judgment? No, sir; he got up at five the next morning in the most prom", "2": "pt and unostentatious way. I knew he would; I knew it mighty well. He collected his lifeinsurance, and lived happy ever after, f", "3": "or there was plenty of proof as to the perfect squareness of his death. \u201cWell, we were gradually fading toward a better land, on", "4": " account of the daily loss of sleep; so we finally had the expert up again, and he ran a wire to the outside of the door, and pl", "5": "aced a switch there, whereby Thomas, the butler, always made one little mistakehe switched the alarm off at night when he went t", "6": "o bed, and switched it on again at daybreak in the morning, just in time for the cook to open the kitchen door, and enable that ", "7": "gong to slam us across the house, sometimes breaking a window with one or the other of us. At the end of a week we recognized th", "8": "at this switch business was a delusion and a snare. We also discovered that a band of burglars had been lodging in the house the", "9": " whole timenot exactly to steal, for there wasn't much left now, but to hide from the police, for they were hot pressed, and the", "10": "y shrewdly judged that the detectives would never think of a tribe of burglars taking sanctuary in a house notoriously protected", "11": " by the most imposing and elaborate burglar alarm in America. \u201cSent down for the expert again, and this time he struck a most da", "12": "zzling ideahe fixed the thing so that opening the kitchen door would take off the alarm. It was a noble idea, and he charged acc", "13": "ordingly. But you already foresee the result. I switched on the alarm every night at bedtime, no longer trusting on Thomas's fra", "14": "il memory; and as soon as the lights were out the burglars walked in at the kitchen door, thus taking the alarm off without wait", "15": "ing for the cook to do it in the morning. You see how aggravatingly we were situated. For months we couldn't have any company. N", "16": "ot a spare bed in the house; all occupied by burglars. \u201cFinally, I got up a cure of my own. The expert answered the call, and ra", "17": "n another ground wire to the stable, and established a switch there, so that the coachman could put on and take off the alarm. T", "18": "hat worked first rate, and a season of peace ensued, during which we got to inviting company once more and enjoying life. \u201cBut b", "19": "y and by the irrepressible alarm invented a new kink. One winter's night we were flung out of bed by the sudden music of that aw", "20": "ful gong, and when we hobbled to the annunciator, turned up the gas, and saw the word 'Nursery' exposed, Mrs. McWilliams fainted", "21": " dead away, and I came precious near doing the same thing myself. I seized my shotgun, and stood timing the coachman whilst that", "22": " appalling buzzing went on. I knew that his gong had flung him out, too, and that he would be along with his gun as soon as he c", "23": "ould jump into his clothes. When I judged that the time was ripe, I crept to the room next the nursery, glanced through the wind", "24": "ow, and saw the dim outline of the coachman in the yard below, standing at presentarms and waiting for a chance. Then I hopped i", "25": "nto the nursery and fired, and in the same instant the coachman fired at the red flash of my gun. Both of us were successful; I ", "26": "crippled a nurse, and he shot off all my back hair. We turned up the gas, and telephoned for a surgeon. There was not a sign of ", "27": "a burglar, and no window had been raised. One glass was absent, but that was where the coachman's charge had come through. Here ", "28": "was a fine mysterya burglar alarm 'going off' at midnight of its own accord, and not a burglar in the neighborhood! \u201cThe expert ", "29": "answered the usual call, and explained that it was a 'False alarm.' Said it was easily fixed. So he overhauled the nursery windo", "30": "w, charged a remunerative figure for it, and departed. \u201cWhat we suffered from false alarms for the next three years no stylograp", "31": "hic pen can describe. During the next three months I always flew with my gun to the room indicated, and the coachman always sall", "32": "ied forth with his battery to support me. But there was never anything to shoot atwindows all tight and secure. We always sent d", "33": "own for the expert next day, and he fixed those particular windows so they would keep quiet a week or so, and always remembered ", "34": "to send us a bill about like this: Wire ............................$2.15 Nipple...........................  .75 Two hours\u2019 labo", "35": "r ................ 1.50 Wax..............................  .47 Tape.............................  .34 Screws....................", "36": ".......  .15 Recharging battery ..............  .98 Three hours\u2019 labor .............. 2.25 String...........................  .0", "37": "2 Lard ............................  .66 Pond's Extract .................. 1.25 Springs at 50.................... 2.00 Railroad ", "38": "fares................... 7.25 \u2014\u2014\u2014 19.77 \u201cAt length a perfectly natural thing came aboutafter we had answered three or four hundr", "39": "ed false alarmsto wit, we stopped answering them. Yes, I simply rose up calmly, when slammed across the house by the alarm, calm", "40": "ly inspected the annunciator, took note of the room indicated; and then calmly disconnected that room from the alarm, and went b", "41": "ack to bed as if nothing had happened. Moreover, I left that room off permanently, and did not send for the expert. Well, it goe", "42": "s without saying that in the course of time all the rooms were taken off, and the entire machine was out of service. \u201cIt was at ", "43": "this unprotected time that the heaviest calamity of all happened. The burglars walked in one night and carried off the burglar a", "44": "larm! yes, sir, every hide and hair of it: ripped it out, tooth and nail; springs, bells, gongs, battery, and all; they took a h", "45": "undred and fifty miles of copper wire; they just cleaned her out, bag and baggage, and never left us a vestige of her to swear a", "46": "tswear by, I mean. \u201cWe had a time of it to get her back; but we accomplished it finally, for money. The alarm firm said that wha", "47": "t we needed now was to have her put in rightwith their new patent springs in the windows to make false alarms impossible, and th", "48": "eir new patent clock attached to take off and put on the alarm morning and night without human assistance. That seemed a good sc", "49": "heme. They promised to have the whole thing finished in ten days. They began work, and we left for the summer. They worked a cou", "50": "ple of days; then they left for the summer. After which the burglars moved in, and began their summer vacation. When we returned", "51": " in the fall, the house was as empty as a beer closet in premises where painters have been at work. We refurnished, and then sen", "52": "t down to hurry up the expert. He came up and finished the job, and said: 'Now this clock is set to put on the alarm every night", "53": " at 10, and take it off every morning at 5:45. All you've got to do is to wind her up every week, and then leave her aloneshe wi", "54": "ll take care of the alarm herself.' \u201cAfter that we had a most tranquil season during three months. The bill was prodigious, of c", "55": "ourse, and I had said I would not pay it until the new machinery had proved itself to be flawless. The time stipulated was three", "56": " months. So I paid the bill, and the very next day the alarm went to buzzing like ten thousand bee swarms at ten o'clock in the ", "57": "morning. I turned the hands around twelve hours, according to instructions, and this took off the alarm; but there was another h", "58": "itch at night, and I had to set her ahead twelve hours once more to get her to put the alarm on again.

I dreamt that a big motor stopped in front of the house ", "13": "and that detectives stepped out of it.\u201d The car had passed the garden gate, but the shock it had given us remained.

If only I were gone from here and knew", "15": " that the people who had befriended me were no longer incurring danger on my behalf! I made a miserable attempt to say something", "16": " to that effect: \u201cThank you, and please forgive me.\u201d Henriette Apor gave me her box of matches: there were only a few left in it", "17": ", yet it was a precious gift, for there had been no matches in the house for a long time. I never thought a human being could be", "18": " so alone in the world. Now everybody must be for himself only.

It had been of no use to hold their hands, to adjust their pillows, to sit up with them. And now there was nobody even to hold", "21": " my hand, to sit up with me. The rain began to fall in scattered drops, as though a sad spirit had wept upon the window panes. O", "22": "n that fateful night of March it had rained thus when I left my home and the streets resounded with the shout: \u201cLong live the Di", "23": "ctatorship of the Proletariat!\u201d These had been the words that brought calamity upon us.

Night stood in front of me like a damp black wall, t", "29": "hrough which I must pass. For an instant I felt as if someone were dogging my footsteps. The gate slammed with a bang behind me ", "30": "and made me feel as if all gates had closed on me and as if I were excluded from everything; a homeless, countryless, beggarly w", "31": "anderer on earth.

Suddenly I could go no furt", "33": "her, I had come to the end of the train, to the last carriage.

He shook his head and seemed to be swearing. Was he looking for me? At all events he jumped back into the train. Night was n", "49": "ow falling and we had to wait a long time in the station, for the enginedriver had gone to an inn for his supper. A passenger sa", "50": "id that they had sent for him but that he had replied: \u201cLet them get up steam themselves.\u201d It was night before we started again,", "51": " and rain began to fall.

For an instant I caught sight of the man in the short fur coat going towards the town. Then the ", "56": "lights of the station went out, and I was alone in the dark at the foot of the tree.

Every time the h", "61": "and had been nearer. One lucky movement and it would have got me.

A", "63": " broad street overshadowed by trees led from the station to the town. Should I follow that? I retained a confused memory of the ", "64": "instructions Elisabeth K\u00e1llay had given me. Soldiers came towards me, then a few people, at last a little boy. I resolved to con"}, "294": {"1": "fide in the latter. \u201cWill you help me to carry my bag?\u201d The boy caught hold of it but it was too heavy for him, so we carried it", "2": " together. After all, that had not been my object. What I really wanted was to find the house of Alad\u00e1r Husz\u00e1r. The boy was not ", "3": "quite sure of it, but he led bravely on through the rain. We left gardens and small villas behind us and came in sight of a chur", "4": "ch by dripping trees and a soaking sandy road. A woman was standing in one of the doorways: She put us right: \u201cThe end of the to", "5": "wn, the last house but one.\u201d New anxieties now took hold of me: up till the present I had only worried about finding my way, and", "6": " now that I had found it, it occurred to me that they might have left the town.

The boy passed through an iron gate and we went up ", "9": "a few steps till we came to a door with glass panes. I was very nervous. I was going to ask for shelter from people who themselv", "10": "es were threatened. I felt painfully ashamed of myself. \u201cThere is the bell!\u201d the boy said. Yet I still hesitated. Only those who", "11": " have stood on a stranger\u2019s threshold, doubting the quality of their welcome, can appreciate my feelings. The boy deposited the ", "12": "bag, asked for his money and ran away. The ringing of the bell broke the silence of the house, and the sudden sound frightened m", "13": "e.

The primitive melodies of the cowherd mingled with the tram", "49": "pling of the cattle. But where was I? Something gripped my heart and forced the truth from it. A fugitive, an outlaw! I looked o", "50": "ut of the window: cows were coming down the little street on the outskirts of the town. Everything was different from my surroun", "51": "dings of yesterday. The house opposite was indifferently, ignorantly looking at its reflection in the puddles. Somewhere in that", "52": " direction the railway station must lie, and the road to it crosses the square in front of the town hall. I had a good idea what", "53": " this square must be like. A big market with arcades, an old fountain, the old town hall with its tower.... Yes, it must be like", "54": " that. \u201cGood morning!\u201d The children\u2019s clear voices called me from the next room. Breakfast was ready on a glasscovered verandah,", "55": " opening on to the back garden.

Gregory, the faithful o", "60": "ld coachman, put his head in. \u201cTwo armed Reds are here!\u201d he exclaimed. I clasped my hands in terror. Mrs. Husz\u00e1r turned white to", "61": " the lips: \u201cWhat are we to do if they are after you? The town is full of detectives.\u201d She went out and when she came back she wa", "62": "s laughing. \u201cI was never so frightened in my life.

There is no change, and our deliverers still hesitate. But within our shamefully constricted frontiers ", "11": "the outlines of the picture become clear, and the undermining of society goes on with devilish speed. The newspapers which reach", "12": "ed us this day publish an incredible order\u2014the sixtysecond within three weeks. \u201cThe Revolutionary Cabinet considers it its duty ", "13": "to revise the procedure of such criminal proceedings as have been instituted before the proclamation of the Soviet, so as to sav", "14": "e from punishment those Proletarians who were called before the tribunals by the old order in the interest of capitalism alone, ", "15": "and, on the other hand, to punish severely, those who have sinned against the working Proletarians.\u201d This order is without prece", "16": "dent in the history of human law. It destroys at a blow the progress of centuries. It endows the privileged and only recognised ", "17": "class, the Proletarians, with the monopoly of crime. Even in the administration of justice, Bolshevism stands on the basis of cl", "18": "ass hatred and serves the class war. If the Proletarian has robbed a member of the middle classes, he cannot be punished; if he ", "19": "has murdered a bourgeois, he cannot be condemned, because his actions were simply acts of selfdefence against the tyranny of cap", "20": "italism. And after abolishing crime as such, it proceeds to the destruction of its traces. All records are burnt in stacks, and ", "21": "the files of criminal proceedings which might involve those in power today are made away with. B\u00e9la Kun embezzled the funds of a", "22": " workmen\u2019s benevolent society. The papers of the prosecution have been burnt and the leader of the Soviet has purged his honour ", "23": "in the ashes.

Even stamp collections which are ", "28": "worth more than two thousand crowns are taken, the happiness of little schoolboys, the hobby of collectors. The head of the Dire", "29": "ctorium of Balassagyarmat returned yesterday from Budapest. Husz\u00e1r heard him relating proudly in the street that he had spoken w", "30": "ith B\u00e9la Kun himself.

Will they have time to do it? I thought of what the president o", "39": "f the Balassagyarmat Directorate had said. They all talk as if they were to last for ever. Meanwhile, the other bank of the Ipol", "40": "y, the hill with the vineyards, keeps silent. If things were to remain like this for long! The idea tortures me incessantly and ", "41": "forces me to think of my unhappy position. My hosts are hospitable, kind, touchingly so, but have I the right to accept their ge", "42": "nerosity? Alad\u00e1r Husz\u00e1r has given up his office, he declines to serve the Soviet. His wife\u2019s jewels have been seized, they have ", "43": "no food coupons.
